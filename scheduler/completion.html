<h1>Completions - “wait for completion” barrier APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#completions-wait-for-completion-barrier-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction:<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have one or more threads that must wait for some kernel activity
to have reached a point or a specific state, completions can provide a
race-free solution to this problem. Semantically they are somewhat like a
pthread_barrier() and have similar use-cases.</p>
<p>Completions are a code synchronization mechanism which is preferable to any
misuse of locks/semaphores and busy-loops. Any time you think of using
<a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.yield" title="yield"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield()</span></code></a> or some quirky msleep(1) loop to allow something else to proceed,
you probably want to look into using one of the wait_for_completion*()
calls and complete() instead.</p>
<p>The advantage of using completions is that they have a well defined, focused
purpose which makes it very easy to see the intent of the code, but they
also result in more efficient code as all threads can continue execution
until the result is actually needed, and both the waiting and the signalling
is highly efficient using low level scheduler sleep/wakeup facilities.</p>
<p>Completions are built on top of the waitqueue and wakeup infrastructure of
the Linux scheduler. The event the threads on the waitqueue are waiting for
is reduced to a simple flag in ‘struct completion’, appropriately called “done”.</p>
<p>As completions are scheduling related, the code can be found in
kernel/sched/completion.c.</p>
</section>
<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage:<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three main parts to using completions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the initialization of the ‘struct completion’ synchronization object</p></li>
<li><p>the waiting part through a call to one of the variants of wait_for_completion(),</p></li>
<li><p>the signaling side through a call to complete() or complete_all().</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are also some helper functions for checking the state of completions.
Note that while initialization must happen first, the waiting and signaling
part can happen in any order. I.e. it’s entirely normal for a thread
to have marked a completion as ‘done’ before another thread checks whether
it has to wait for it.</p>
<p>To use completions you need to #include &lt;linux/completion.h&gt; and
create a static or dynamic variable of type ‘struct completion’,
which has only two fields:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>struct completion {
        unsigned int done;
        wait_queue_head_t wait;
};
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This provides the -&gt;wait waitqueue to place tasks on for waiting (if any), and
the -&gt;done completion flag for indicating whether it’s completed or not.</p>
<p>Completions should be named to refer to the event that is being synchronized on.
A good example is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wait_for_completion(&amp;early_console_added);

complete(&amp;early_console_added);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Good, intuitive naming (as always) helps code readability. Naming a completion
‘complete’ is not helpful unless the purpose is super obvious…</p>
</section>
<section id="initializing-completions">
<h2>Initializing completions:<a class="headerlink" href="#initializing-completions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dynamically allocated completion objects should preferably be embedded in data
structures that are assured to be alive for the life-time of the function/driver,
to prevent races with asynchronous complete() calls from occurring.</p>
<p>Particular care should be taken when using the _timeout() or _killable()/_interruptible()
variants of wait_for_completion(), as it must be assured that memory de-allocation
does not happen until all related activities (complete() or <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.reinit_completion" title="reinit_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reinit_completion()</span></code></a>)
have taken place, even if these wait functions return prematurely due to a timeout
or a signal triggering.</p>
<p>Initializing of dynamically allocated completion objects is done via a call to
<a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.init_completion" title="init_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init_completion()</span></code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>init_completion(&amp;dynamic_object-&gt;done);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this call we initialize the waitqueue and set -&gt;done to 0, i.e. “not completed”
or “not done”.</p>
<p>The re-initialization function, <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.reinit_completion" title="reinit_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reinit_completion()</span></code></a>, simply resets the
-&gt;done field to 0 (“not done”), without touching the waitqueue.
Callers of this function must make sure that there are no racy
wait_for_completion() calls going on in parallel.</p>
<p>Calling <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.init_completion" title="init_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init_completion()</span></code></a> on the same completion object twice is
most likely a bug as it re-initializes the queue to an empty queue and
enqueued tasks could get “lost” - use <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.reinit_completion" title="reinit_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reinit_completion()</span></code></a> in that case,
but be aware of other races.</p>
<p>For static declaration and initialization, macros are available.</p>
<p>For static (or global) declarations in file scope you can use
<a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.DECLARE_COMPLETION" title="DECLARE_COMPLETION"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DECLARE_COMPLETION()</span></code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>static DECLARE_COMPLETION(setup_done);
DECLARE_COMPLETION(setup_done);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that in this case the completion is boot time (or module load time)
initialized to ‘not done’ and doesn’t require an <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.init_completion" title="init_completion"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init_completion()</span></code></a> call.</p>
<p>When a completion is declared as a local variable within a function,
then the initialization should always use <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK" title="DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK()</span></code></a>
explicitly, not just to make lockdep happy, but also to make it clear
that limited scope had been considered and is intentional:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(setup_done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that when using completion objects as local variables you must be
acutely aware of the short life time of the function stack: the function
must not return to a calling context until all activities (such as waiting
threads) have ceased and the completion object is completely unused.</p>
<p>To emphasise this again: in particular when using some of the waiting API variants
with more complex outcomes, such as the timeout or signalling (_timeout(),
_killable() and _interruptible()) variants, the wait might complete
prematurely while the object might still be in use by another thread - and a return
from the wait_on_completion*() caller function will deallocate the function
stack and cause subtle data corruption if a complete() is done in some
other thread. Simple testing might not trigger these kinds of races.</p>
<p>If unsure, use dynamically allocated completion objects, preferably embedded
in some other long lived object that has a boringly long life time which
exceeds the life time of any helper threads using the completion object,
or has a lock or other synchronization mechanism to make sure complete()
is not called on a freed object.</p>
<p>A naive <a class="reference internal" href="../driver-api/basics.html#c.DECLARE_COMPLETION" title="DECLARE_COMPLETION"><code class="xref c c-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DECLARE_COMPLETION()</span></code></a> on the stack triggers a lockdep warning.</p>
</section>
<section id="waiting-for-completions">
<h2>Waiting for completions:<a class="headerlink" href="#waiting-for-completions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a thread to wait for some concurrent activity to finish, it
calls wait_for_completion() on the initialized completion structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void wait_for_completion(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A typical usage scenario is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CPU#1                                   CPU#2

struct completion setup_done;

init_completion(&amp;setup_done);
initialize_work(...,&amp;setup_done,...);

/* run non-dependent code */            /* do setup */

wait_for_completion(&amp;setup_done);       complete(setup_done);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is not implying any particular order between wait_for_completion() and
the call to complete() - if the call to complete() happened before the call
to wait_for_completion() then the waiting side simply will continue
immediately as all dependencies are satisfied; if not, it will block until
completion is signaled by complete().</p>
<p>Note that wait_for_completion() is calling spin_lock_irq()/spin_unlock_irq(),
so it can only be called safely when you know that interrupts are enabled.
Calling it from IRQs-off atomic contexts will result in hard-to-detect
spurious enabling of interrupts.</p>
<p>The default behavior is to wait without a timeout and to mark the task as
uninterruptible. wait_for_completion() and its variants are only safe
in process context (as they can sleep) but not in atomic context,
interrupt context, with disabled IRQs, or preemption is disabled - see also
try_wait_for_completion() below for handling completion in atomic/interrupt
context.</p>
<p>As all variants of wait_for_completion() can (obviously) block for a long
time depending on the nature of the activity they are waiting for, so in
most cases you probably don’t want to call this with held mutexes.</p>
</section>
<section id="wait-for-completion-variants-available">
<h2>wait_for_completion*() variants available:<a class="headerlink" href="#wait-for-completion-variants-available" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The below variants all return status and this status should be checked in
most(/all) cases - in cases where the status is deliberately not checked you
probably want to make a note explaining this (e.g. see
arch/arm/kernel/smp.c:__cpu_up()).</p>
<p>A common problem that occurs is to have unclean assignment of return types,
so take care to assign return-values to variables of the proper type.</p>
<p>Checking for the specific meaning of return values also has been found
to be quite inaccurate, e.g. constructs like:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (!wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(...))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>… would execute the same code path for successful completion and for the
interrupted case - which is probably not what you want:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int wait_for_completion_interruptible(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This function marks the task TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE while it is waiting.
If a signal was received while waiting it will return -ERESTARTSYS; 0 otherwise:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout(struct completion *done, unsigned long timeout)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The task is marked as TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and will wait at most ‘timeout’
jiffies. If a timeout occurs it returns 0, else the remaining time in
jiffies (but at least 1).</p>
<p>Timeouts are preferably calculated with msecs_to_jiffies() or usecs_to_jiffies(),
to make the code largely HZ-invariant.</p>
<p>If the returned timeout value is deliberately ignored a comment should probably explain
why (e.g. see drivers/mfd/wm8350-core.c wm8350_read_auxadc()):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(struct completion *done, unsigned long timeout)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This function passes a timeout in jiffies and marks the task as
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. If a signal was received it will return -ERESTARTSYS;
otherwise it returns 0 if the completion timed out, or the remaining time in
jiffies if completion occurred.</p>
<p>Further variants include _killable which uses TASK_KILLABLE as the
designated tasks state and will return -ERESTARTSYS if it is interrupted,
or 0 if completion was achieved.  There is a _timeout variant as well:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>long wait_for_completion_killable(struct completion *done)
long wait_for_completion_killable_timeout(struct completion *done, unsigned long timeout)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The _io variants wait_for_completion_io() behave the same as the non-_io
variants, except for accounting waiting time as ‘waiting on IO’, which has
an impact on how the task is accounted in scheduling/IO stats:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void wait_for_completion_io(struct completion *done)
unsigned long wait_for_completion_io_timeout(struct completion *done, unsigned long timeout)
</pre></div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="signaling-completions">
<h2>Signaling completions:<a class="headerlink" href="#signaling-completions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A thread that wants to signal that the conditions for continuation have been
achieved calls complete() to signal exactly one of the waiters that it can
continue:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void complete(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>… or calls complete_all() to signal all current and future waiters:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void complete_all(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The signaling will work as expected even if completions are signaled before
a thread starts waiting. This is achieved by the waiter “consuming”
(decrementing) the done field of ‘struct completion’. Waiting threads
wakeup order is the same in which they were enqueued (FIFO order).</p>
<p>If complete() is called multiple times then this will allow for that number
of waiters to continue - each call to complete() will simply increment the
done field. Calling complete_all() multiple times is a bug though. Both
complete() and complete_all() can be called in IRQ/atomic context safely.</p>
<p>There can only be one thread calling complete() or complete_all() on a
particular ‘struct completion’ at any time - serialized through the wait
queue spinlock. Any such concurrent calls to complete() or complete_all()
probably are a design bug.</p>
<p>Signaling completion from IRQ context is fine as it will appropriately
lock with spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore() and it will never
sleep.</p>
</section>
<section id="try-wait-for-completion-completion-done">
<h2>try_wait_for_completion()/completion_done():<a class="headerlink" href="#try-wait-for-completion-completion-done" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The try_wait_for_completion() function will not put the thread on the wait
queue but rather returns false if it would need to enqueue (block) the thread,
else it consumes one posted completion and returns true:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bool try_wait_for_completion(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, to check the state of a completion without changing it in any way,
call completion_done(), which returns false if there are no posted
completions that were not yet consumed by waiters (implying that there are
waiters) and true otherwise:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bool completion_done(struct completion *done)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Both try_wait_for_completion() and completion_done() are safe to be called in
IRQ or atomic context.</p>
