<h1>Scalable Matrix Extension support for AArch64 Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#scalable-matrix-extension-support-for-aarch64-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document outlines briefly the interface provided to userspace by Linux in
order to support use of the ARM Scalable Matrix Extension (SME).</p>
<p>This is an outline of the most important features and issues only and not
intended to be exhaustive.  It should be read in conjunction with the SVE
documentation in <a class="reference internal" href="sve.html"><span class="doc">Scalable Vector Extension support for AArch64 Linux</span></a> which provides details on the Streaming SVE mode
included in SME.</p>
<p>This document does not aim to describe the SME architecture or programmer’s
model.  To aid understanding, a minimal description of relevant programmer’s
model features for SME is included in Appendix A.</p>
<section id="general">
<h2>1.  General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>PSTATE.SM, PSTATE.ZA, the streaming mode vector length, the ZA
register state and TPIDR2_EL0 are tracked per thread.</p></li>
<li><p>The presence of SME is reported to userspace via HWCAP2_SME in the aux vector
AT_HWCAP2 entry.  Presence of this flag implies the presence of the SME
instructions and registers, and the Linux-specific system interfaces
described in this document.  SME is reported in /proc/cpuinfo as “sme”.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the execution of SME instructions in userspace can also be
detected by reading the CPU ID register ID_AA64PFR1_EL1 using an MRS
instruction, and checking that the value of the SME field is nonzero. [3]</p>
<p>It does not guarantee the presence of the system interfaces described in the
following sections: software that needs to verify that those interfaces are
present must check for HWCAP2_SME instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are a number of optional SME features, presence of these is reported
through AT_HWCAP2 through:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>HWCAP2_SME_I16I64
HWCAP2_SME_F64F64
HWCAP2_SME_I8I32
HWCAP2_SME_F16F32
HWCAP2_SME_B16F32
HWCAP2_SME_F32F32
HWCAP2_SME_FA64</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This list may be extended over time as the SME architecture evolves.</p>
<p>These extensions are also reported via the CPU ID register ID_AA64SMFR0_EL1,
which userspace can read using an MRS instruction.  See <a class="reference internal" href="elf_hwcaps.html"><span class="doc">ARM64 ELF hwcaps</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="cpu-feature-registers.html"><span class="doc">ARM64 CPU Feature Registers</span></a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Debuggers should restrict themselves to interacting with the target via the
NT_ARM_SVE, NT_ARM_SSVE and NT_ARM_ZA regsets.  The recommended way
of detecting support for these regsets is to connect to a target process
first and then attempt a</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET, pid, NT_ARM_&lt;regset&gt;, &amp;iov).</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Whenever ZA register values are exchanged in memory between userspace and
the kernel, the register value is encoded in memory as a series of horizontal
vectors from 0 to VL/8-1 stored in the same endianness invariant format as is
used for SVE vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>On thread creation TPIDR2_EL0 is preserved unless CLONE_SETTLS is specified,
in which case it is set to 0.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="vector-lengths">
<h2>2.  Vector lengths<a class="headerlink" href="#vector-lengths" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SME defines a second vector length similar to the SVE vector length which is
controls the size of the streaming mode SVE vectors and the ZA matrix array.
The ZA matrix is square with each side having as many bytes as a streaming
mode SVE vector.</p>
</section>
<section id="sharing-of-streaming-and-non-streaming-mode-sve-state">
<h2>3.  Sharing of streaming and non-streaming mode SVE state<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-of-streaming-and-non-streaming-mode-sve-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is implementation defined which if any parts of the SVE state are shared
between streaming and non-streaming modes.  When switching between modes
via software interfaces such as ptrace if no register content is provided as
part of switching no state will be assumed to be shared and everything will
be zeroed.</p>
</section>
<section id="system-call-behaviour">
<h2>4.  System call behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#system-call-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On syscall PSTATE.ZA is preserved, if PSTATE.ZA==1 then the contents of the
ZA matrix are preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>On syscall PSTATE.SM will be cleared and the SVE registers will be handled
as per the standard SVE ABI.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither the SVE registers nor ZA are used to pass arguments to or receive
results from any syscall.</p></li>
<li><p>On process creation (eg, clone()) the newly created process will have
PSTATE.SM cleared.</p></li>
<li><p>All other SME state of a thread, including the currently configured vector
length, the state of the PR_SME_VL_INHERIT flag, and the deferred vector
length (if any), is preserved across all syscalls, subject to the specific
exceptions for execve() described in section 6.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="signal-handling">
<h2>5.  Signal handling<a class="headerlink" href="#signal-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Signal handlers are invoked with streaming mode and ZA disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>A new signal frame record za_context encodes the ZA register contents on
signal delivery. [1]</p></li>
<li><p>The signal frame record for ZA always contains basic metadata, in particular
the thread’s vector length (in za_context.vl).</p></li>
<li><p>The ZA matrix may or may not be included in the record, depending on
the value of PSTATE.ZA.  The registers are present if and only if:
za_context.head.size &gt;= ZA_SIG_CONTEXT_SIZE(sve_vq_from_vl(za_context.vl))
in which case PSTATE.ZA == 1.</p></li>
<li><p>If matrix data is present, the remainder of the record has a vl-dependent
size and layout.  Macros ZA_SIG_* are defined [1] to facilitate access to
them.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix is stored as a series of horizontal vectors in the same format as
is used for SVE vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ZA context is too big to fit in sigcontext.__reserved[], then extra
space is allocated on the stack, an extra_context record is written in
__reserved[] referencing this space.  za_context is then written in the
extra space.  Refer to [1] for further details about this mechanism.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="signal-return">
<h2>5.  Signal return<a class="headerlink" href="#signal-return" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When returning from a signal handler:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there is no za_context record in the signal frame, or if the record is
present but contains no register data as described in the previous section,
then ZA is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>If za_context is present in the signal frame and contains matrix data then
PSTATE.ZA is set to 1 and ZA is populated with the specified data.</p></li>
<li><p>The vector length cannot be changed via signal return.  If za_context.vl in
the signal frame does not match the current vector length, the signal return
attempt is treated as illegal, resulting in a forced SIGSEGV.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="prctl-extensions">
<h2>6.  prctl extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#prctl-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some new prctl() calls are added to allow programs to manage the SME vector
length:</p>
<p>prctl(PR_SME_SET_VL, unsigned long arg)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sets the vector length of the calling thread and related flags, where
arg == vl | flags.  Other threads of the calling process are unaffected.</p>
<p>vl is the desired vector length, where sve_vl_valid(vl) must be true.</p>
<p>flags:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PR_SME_VL_INHERIT</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Inherit the current vector length across execve().  Otherwise, the
vector length is reset to the system default at execve().  (See
Section 9.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>PR_SME_SET_VL_ONEXEC</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Defer the requested vector length change until the next execve()
performed by this thread.</p>
<p>The effect is equivalent to implicit execution of the following
call immediately after the next execve() (if any) by the thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>prctl(PR_SME_SET_VL, arg &amp; ~PR_SME_SET_VL_ONEXEC)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This allows launching of a new program with a different vector
length, while avoiding runtime side effects in the caller.</p>
<p>Without PR_SME_SET_VL_ONEXEC, the requested change takes effect
immediately.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Return value: a nonnegative on success, or a negative value on error:</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>EINVAL: SME not supported, invalid vector length requested, or</dt><dd><p>invalid flags.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>On success:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Either the calling thread’s vector length or the deferred vector length
to be applied at the next execve() by the thread (dependent on whether
PR_SME_SET_VL_ONEXEC is present in arg), is set to the largest value
supported by the system that is less than or equal to vl.  If vl ==
SVE_VL_MAX, the value set will be the largest value supported by the
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Any previously outstanding deferred vector length change in the calling
thread is cancelled.</p></li>
<li><p>The returned value describes the resulting configuration, encoded as for
PR_SME_GET_VL.  The vector length reported in this value is the new
current vector length for this thread if PR_SME_SET_VL_ONEXEC was not
present in arg; otherwise, the reported vector length is the deferred
vector length that will be applied at the next execve() by the calling
thread.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the vector length causes all of ZA, P0..P15, FFR and all bits of
Z0..Z31 except for Z0 bits [127:0] .. Z31 bits [127:0] to become
unspecified, including both streaming and non-streaming SVE state.
Calling PR_SME_SET_VL with vl equal to the thread’s current vector
length, or calling PR_SME_SET_VL with the PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC flag,
does not constitute a change to the vector length for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the vector length causes PSTATE.ZA and PSTATE.SM to be cleared.
Calling PR_SME_SET_VL with vl equal to the thread’s current vector
length, or calling PR_SME_SET_VL with the PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC flag,
does not constitute a change to the vector length for this purpose.</p></li>

vector length change (which would only normally be the case between a

<h2>A.1.  Registers<a class="headerlink" href="#a-1-registers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In A64 state, SME adds the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new mode, streaming mode, in which a subset of the normal FPSIMD and SVE
features are available.  When supported EL0 software may enter and leave
streaming mode at any time.</p>
<p>For best system performance it is strongly encouraged for software to enable
streaming mode only when it is actively being used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new vector length controlling the size of ZA and the Z registers when in
streaming mode, separately to the vector length used for SVE when not in
streaming mode.  There is no requirement that either the currently selected
vector length or the set of vector lengths supported for the two modes in
a given system have any relationship.  The streaming mode vector length
is referred to as SVL.</p></li>
<li><p>A new ZA matrix register.  This is a square matrix of SVLxSVL bits.  Most
operations on ZA require that streaming mode be enabled but ZA can be
enabled without streaming mode in order to load, save and retain data.</p>
<p>For best system performance it is strongly encouraged for software to enable
ZA only when it is actively being used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two new 1 bit fields in PSTATE which may be controlled via the SMSTART and
SMSTOP instructions or by access to the SVCR system register:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PSTATE.ZA, if this is 1 then the ZA matrix is accessible and has valid
data while if it is 0 then ZA can not be accessed.  When PSTATE.ZA is
changed from 0 to 1 all bits in ZA are cleared.</p></li>
<li><p>PSTATE.SM, if this is 1 then the PE is in streaming mode.  When the value
of PSTATE.SM is changed then it is implementation defined if the subset
of the floating point register bits valid in both modes may be retained.
Any other bits will be cleared.</p></li>
