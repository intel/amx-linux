<h2>Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The driver is generic, i.e., it does not contain any code tailored
to any specific tape drive. The tape parameters can be specified with
one of the following three methods:</p>
<p>1. Each user can specify the tape parameters he/she wants to use
directly with ioctls. This is administratively a very simple and
flexible method and applicable to single-user workstations. However,
in a multiuser environment the next user finds the tape parameters in
state the previous user left them.</p>
<p>2. The system manager (root) can define default values for some tape
parameters, like block size and density using the MTSETDRVBUFFER ioctl.
These parameters can be programmed to come into effect either when a
new tape is loaded into the drive or if writing begins at the
beginning of the tape. The second method is applicable if the tape
drive performs auto-detection of the tape format well (like some
QIC-drives). The result is that any tape can be read, writing can be
continued using existing format, and the default format is used if
the tape is rewritten from the beginning (or a new tape is written
for the first time). The first method is applicable if the drive
does not perform auto-detection well enough and there is a single
“sensible” mode for the device. An example is a DAT drive that is
used only in variable block mode (I don’t know if this is sensible
or not :-).</p>
<p>The user can override the parameters defined by the system
manager. The changes persist until the defaults again come into
effect.</p>
<p>3. By default, up to four modes can be defined and selected using the minor
number (bits 5 and 6). The number of modes can be changed by changing
ST_NBR_MODE_BITS in st.h. Mode 0 corresponds to the defaults discussed
above. Additional modes are dormant until they are defined by the
system manager (root). When specification of a new mode is started,
the configuration of mode 0 is used to provide a starting point for
definition of the new mode.</p>
<p>Using the modes allows the system manager to give the users choices
over some of the buffering parameters not directly accessible to the
users (buffered and asynchronous writes). The modes also allow choices
between formats in multi-tape operations (the explicitly overridden
parameters are reset when a new tape is loaded).</p>
<p>If more than one mode is used, all modes should contain definitions
for the same set of parameters.</p>
<p>Many Unices contain internal tables that associate different modes to
supported devices. The Linux SCSI tape driver does not contain such
tables (and will not do that in future). Instead of that, a utility
program can be made that fetches the inquiry data sent by the device,
scans its database, and sets up the modes using the ioctls. Another
alternative is to make a small script that uses mt to set the defaults
tailored to the system.</p>
<p>The driver supports fixed and variable block size (within buffer
limits). Both the auto-rewind (minor equals device number) and
non-rewind devices (minor is 128 + device number) are implemented.</p>
<p>In variable block mode, the byte count in write() determines the size
of the physical block on tape. When reading, the drive reads the next
tape block and returns to the user the data if the read() byte count
is at least the block size. Otherwise, error ENOMEM is returned.</p>
<p>In fixed block mode, the data transfer between the drive and the
driver is in multiples of the block size. The write() byte count must
be a multiple of the block size. This is not required when reading but
may be advisable for portability.</p>
<p>Support is provided for changing the tape partition and partitioning
of the tape with one or two partitions. By default support for
partitioned tape is disabled for each driver and it can be enabled
with the ioctl MTSETDRVBUFFER.</p>
<p>By default the driver writes one filemark when the device is closed after
writing and the last operation has been a write. Two filemarks can be
optionally written. In both cases end of data is signified by
returning zero bytes for two consecutive reads.</p>
<p>Writing filemarks without the immediate bit set in the SCSI command block acts
as a synchronization point, i.e., all remaining data form the drive buffers is
written to tape before the command returns. This makes sure that write errors
are caught at that point, but this takes time. In some applications, several
consecutive files must be written fast. The MTWEOFI operation can be used to
write the filemarks without flushing the drive buffer. Writing filemark at
close() is always flushing the drive buffers. However, if the previous
operation is MTWEOFI, close() does not write a filemark. This can be used if
the program wants to close/open the tape device between files and wants to
skip waiting.</p>
<p>If rewind, offline, bsf, or seek is done and previous tape operation was
write, a filemark is written before moving tape.</p>
<p>The compile options are defined in the file linux/drivers/scsi/st_options.h.</p>
<p>4. If the open option O_NONBLOCK is used, open succeeds even if the
drive is not ready. If O_NONBLOCK is not used, the driver waits for
the drive to become ready. If this does not happen in ST_BLOCK_SECONDS
seconds, open fails with the errno value EIO. With O_NONBLOCK the
device can be opened for writing even if there is a write protected
tape in the drive (commands trying to write something return error if
attempted).</p>
</section>
<section id="minor-numbers">
<h2>Minor Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The tape driver currently supports up to 2^17 drives if 4 modes for
each drive are used.</p>
<p>The minor numbers consist of the following bit fields:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dev_upper non-rew mode dev-lower
20 -  8     7    6 5  4      0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The non-rewind bit is always bit 7 (the uppermost bit in the lowermost
byte). The bits defining the mode are below the non-rewind bit. The
remaining bits define the tape device number. This numbering is
backward compatible with the numbering used when the minor number was
only 8 bits wide.</p>
</section>
<section id="sysfs-support">
<h2>Sysfs Support<a class="headerlink" href="#sysfs-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The driver creates the directory /sys/class/scsi_tape and populates it with
directories corresponding to the existing tape devices. There are autorewind
and non-rewind entries for each mode. The names are stxy and nstxy, where x
is the tape number and y a character corresponding to the mode (none, l, m,
a). For example, the directories for the first tape device are (assuming four
modes): st0  nst0  st0l  nst0l  st0m  nst0m  st0a  nst0a.</p>
<p>Each directory contains the entries: default_blksize  default_compression
default_density  defined  dev  device  driver. The file ‘defined’ contains 1
if the mode is defined and zero if not defined. The files ‘default_*’ contain
the defaults set by the user. The value -1 means the default is not set. The
file ‘dev’ contains the device numbers corresponding to this device. The links
‘device’ and ‘driver’ point to the SCSI device and driver entries.</p>
<p>Each directory also contains the entry ‘options’ which shows the currently
enabled driver and mode options. The value in the file is a bit mask where the
bit definitions are the same as those used with MTSETDRVBUFFER in setting the
options.</p>
<p>A link named ‘tape’ is made from the SCSI device directory to the class
directory corresponding to the mode 0 auto-rewind device (e.g., st0).</p>

<section id="sysfs-and-statistics-for-tape-devices">
<h2>Sysfs and Statistics for Tape Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#sysfs-and-statistics-for-tape-devices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The st driver maintains statistics for tape drives inside the sysfs filesystem.
The following method can be used to locate the statistics that are
available (assuming that sysfs is mounted at /sys):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use opendir(3) on the directory /sys/class/scsi_tape</p></li>
<li><p>Use readdir(3) to read the directory contents</p></li>
<li><p>Use regcomp(3)/regexec(3) to match directory entries to the extended
regular expression “^st[0-9]+$”</p></li>
<li><p>Access the statistics from the /sys/class/scsi_tape/&lt;match&gt;/stats
directory (where &lt;match&gt; is a directory entry from /sys/class/scsi_tape
that matched the extended regular expression)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for using this approach is that all the character devices
pointing to the same tape drive use the same statistics. That means
that st0 would have the same statistics as nst0.</p>
<p>The directory contains the following statistics files:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>in_flight</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The number of I/Os currently outstanding to this device.</p></li>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The in_flight value is incremented when an I/O starts the I/O

</div>
<p>The total of read_cnt, write_cnt, and other_cnt may not total to the same
value as iodone_cnt at the device level. The tape statistics only count
I/O issued via the st module.</p>
<p>When read the statistics may not be temporally consistent while I/O is in
progress. The individual values are read and written to atomically however
when reading them back via sysfs they may be in the process of being
updated when starting an I/O or when it is completed.</p>
<p>The value shown in in_flight is incremented before any statstics are
updated and decremented when an I/O completes after updating statistics.
The value of in_flight is 0 when there are no I/Os outstanding that are
issued by the st driver. Tape statistics do not take into account any
I/O performed via the sg device.</p>

<section id="bsd-and-sys-v-semantics">
<h2>BSD and Sys V Semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#bsd-and-sys-v-semantics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The user can choose between these two behaviours of the tape driver by
defining the value of the symbol ST_SYSV. The semantics differ when a
file being read is closed. The BSD semantics leaves the tape where it
currently is whereas the SYS V semantics moves the tape past the next
filemark unless the filemark has just been crossed.</p>
<p>The default is BSD semantics.</p>
</section>
<section id="buffering">
<h2>Buffering<a class="headerlink" href="#buffering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The driver tries to do transfers directly to/from user space. If this
is not possible, a driver buffer allocated at run-time is used. If
direct i/o is not possible for the whole transfer, the driver buffer
is used (i.e., bounce buffers for individual pages are not
used). Direct i/o can be impossible because of several reasons, e.g.:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>one or more pages are at addresses not reachable by the HBA</p></li>
<li><p>the number of pages in the transfer exceeds the number of
scatter/gather segments permitted by the HBA</p></li>
<li><p>one or more pages can’t be locked into memory (should not happen in
any reasonable situation)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the driver buffers is always at least one tape block. In fixed
block mode, the minimum buffer size is defined (in 1024 byte units) by
ST_FIXED_BUFFER_BLOCKS. With small block size this allows buffering of
several blocks and using one SCSI read or write to transfer all of the
blocks. Buffering of data across write calls in fixed block mode is
allowed if ST_BUFFER_WRITES is non-zero and direct i/o is not used.
Buffer allocation uses chunks of memory having sizes 2^n * (page
size). Because of this the actual buffer size may be larger than the
minimum allowable buffer size.</p>
<p>NOTE that if direct i/o is used, the small writes are not buffered. This may
cause a surprise when moving from 2.4. There small writes (e.g., tar without
-b option) may have had good throughput but this is not true any more with
2.6. Direct i/o can be turned off to solve this problem but a better solution
is to use bigger write() byte counts (e.g., tar -b 64).</p>
<p>Asynchronous writing. Writing the buffer contents to the tape is
started and the write call returns immediately. The status is checked
at the next tape operation. Asynchronous writes are not done with
direct i/o and not in fixed block mode.</p>
<p>Buffered writes and asynchronous writes may in some rare cases cause
problems in multivolume operations if there is not enough space on the
tape after the early-warning mark to flush the driver buffer.</p>
<p>Read ahead for fixed block mode (ST_READ_AHEAD). Filling the buffer is
attempted even if the user does not want to get all of the data at
this read command. Should be disabled for those drives that don’t like
a filemark to truncate a read request or that don’t like backspacing.</p>
<p>Scatter/gather buffers (buffers that consist of chunks non-contiguous
in the physical memory) are used if contiguous buffers can’t be
allocated. To support all SCSI adapters (including those not
supporting scatter/gather), buffer allocation is using the following
three kinds of chunks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The initial segment that is used for all SCSI adapters including
those not supporting scatter/gather. The size of this buffer will be
(PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; ST_FIRST_ORDER) bytes if the system can give a chunk of
this size (and it is not larger than the buffer size specified by
ST_BUFFER_BLOCKS). If this size is not available, the driver halves
the size and tries again until the size of one page. The default
settings in st_options.h make the driver to try to allocate all of the
buffer as one chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>The scatter/gather segments to fill the specified buffer size are
allocated so that as many segments as possible are used but the number
of segments does not exceed ST_FIRST_SG.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining segments between ST_MAX_SG (or the module parameter
max_sg_segs) and the number of segments used in phases 1 and 2
are used to extend the buffer at run-time if this is necessary. The
number of scatter/gather segments allowed for the SCSI adapter is not
exceeded if it is smaller than the maximum number of scatter/gather
segments specified. If the maximum number allowed for the SCSI adapter
is smaller than the number of segments used in phases 1 and 2,
extending the buffer will always fail.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="eom-behaviour-when-writing">
<h2>EOM Behaviour When Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#eom-behaviour-when-writing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the end of medium early warning is encountered, the current write
is finished and the number of bytes is returned. The next write
returns -1 and errno is set to ENOSPC. To enable writing a trailer,
the next write is allowed to proceed and, if successful, the number of
bytes is returned. After this, -1 and the number of bytes are
alternately returned until the physical end of medium (or some other
error) is encountered.</p>

<section id="module-parameters">
<h2>Module Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#module-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The buffer size, write threshold, and the maximum number of allocated buffers
are configurable when the driver is loaded as a module. The keywords are:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 38%" />
<col style="width: 62%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>buffer_kbs=xxx</p></td>

<p>Note that if the buffer size is changed but the write threshold is not
set, the write threshold is set to the new buffer size - 2 kB.</p>

<section id="boot-time-configuration">
<h2>Boot Time Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#boot-time-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the driver is compiled into the kernel, the same parameters can be
also set using, e.g., the LILO command line. The preferred syntax is
to use the same keyword used when loading as module but prepended
with ‘st.’. For instance, to set the maximum number of scatter/gather
segments, the parameter ‘st.max_sg_segs=xx’ should be used (xx is the
number of scatter/gather segments).</p>
<p>For compatibility, the old syntax from early 2.5 and 2.4 kernel
versions is supported. The same keywords can be used as when loading
the driver as module. If several parameters are set, the keyword-value
pairs are separated with a comma (no spaces allowed). A colon can be
used instead of the equal mark. The definition is prepended by the
string st=. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>st=buffer_kbs:64,write_threshold_kbs:60
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following syntax used by the old kernel versions is also supported:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>st=aa[,bb[,dd]]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>aa is the buffer size for fixed block mode in 1024 byte units</p></li>
<li><p>bb is the write threshold in 1024 byte units</p></li>

reserved) and &lt;= the maximum requested sense data sixe),
a mask to select the relevant bits (the bits 9-16), and the

the pattern is non-zero, the pattern must match the masked

The drive type is either MTISSCSI1 or MTISSCSI2.
The number of recovered errors since the previous status call
is stored in the lower word of the field mt_erreg.
The current block size and the density code are stored in the field
mt_dsreg (shifts for the subfields are MT_ST_BLKSIZE_SHIFT and
MT_ST_DENSITY_SHIFT).
The GMT_xxx status bits reflect the drive status. GMT_DR_OPEN
is set if there is no tape in the drive. GMT_EOD means either
end of recorded data or end of tape. GMT_EOT means end of tape.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Compile Options<a class="headerlink" href="#miscellaneous-compile-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The recovered write errors are considered fatal if ST_RECOVERED_WRITE_FATAL
is defined.</p>
<p>The maximum number of tape devices is determined by the define
ST_MAX_TAPES. If more tapes are detected at driver initialization, the
maximum is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Immediate return from tape positioning SCSI commands can be enabled by
defining ST_NOWAIT. If this is defined, the user should take care that
the next tape operation is not started before the previous one has
finished. The drives and SCSI adapters should handle this condition
gracefully, but some drive/adapter combinations are known to hang the
SCSI bus in this case.</p>
<p>The MTEOM command is by default implemented as spacing over 32767
filemarks. With this method the file number in the status is
correct. The user can request using direct spacing to EOD by setting
ST_FAST_EOM 1 (or using the MT_ST_OPTIONS ioctl). In this case the file
number will be invalid.</p>
<p>When using read ahead or buffered writes the position within the file
may not be correct after the file is closed (correct position may
require backspacing over more than one record). The correct position
within file can be obtained if ST_IN_FILE_POS is defined at compile
time or the MT_ST_CAN_BSR bit is set for the drive with an ioctl.
(The driver always backs over a filemark crossed by read ahead if the
user does not request data that far.)</p>

<section id="debugging-hints">
<h2>Debugging Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging-hints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Debugging code is now compiled in by default but debugging is turned off
with the kernel module parameter debug_flag defaulting to 0.  Debugging
can still be switched on and off with an ioctl.  To enable debug at
module load time add debug_flag=1 to the module load options, the
debugging output is not voluminous. Debugging can also be enabled
and disabled by writing a ‘0’ (disable) or ‘1’ (enable) to the sysfs
file /sys/bus/scsi/drivers/st/debug_flag.</p>
<p>If the tape seems to hang, I would be very interested to hear where
the driver is waiting. With the command ‘ps -l’ you can see the state
of the process using the tape. If the state is D, the process is
waiting for something. The field WCHAN tells where the driver is
waiting. If you have the current System.map in the correct place (in
/boot for the procps I use) or have updated /etc/psdatabase (for kmem
ps), ps writes the function name in the WCHAN field. If not, you have
to look up the function from System.map.</p>
<p>Note also that the timeouts are very long compared to most other
drivers. This means that the Linux driver may appear hung although the
real reason is that the tape firmware has got confused.</p>
