<h2>What is FUSE?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-fuse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FUSE is a userspace filesystem framework.  It consists of a kernel
module (fuse.ko), a userspace library (libfuse.*) and a mount utility
(fusermount).</p>
<p>One of the most important features of FUSE is allowing secure,
non-privileged mounts.  This opens up new possibilities for the use of
filesystems.  A good example is sshfs: a secure network filesystem
using the sftp protocol.</p>
<p>The userspace library and utilities are available from the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/libfuse/">FUSE homepage:</a></p>

<h2>Control filesystem<a class="headerlink" href="#control-filesystem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There’s a control filesystem for FUSE, which can be mounted by:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mount -t fusectl none /sys/fs/fuse/connections

<p>Mounting it under the ‘/sys/fs/fuse/connections’ directory makes it

<section id="interrupting-filesystem-operations">
<h3>Interrupting filesystem operations<a class="headerlink" href="#interrupting-filesystem-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a process issuing a FUSE filesystem request is interrupted, the
following will happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the request is not yet sent to userspace AND the signal is
fatal (SIGKILL or unhandled fatal signal), then the request is
dequeued and returns immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If the request is not yet sent to userspace AND the signal is not
fatal, then an interrupted flag is set for the request.  When
the request has been successfully transferred to userspace and
this flag is set, an INTERRUPT request is queued.</p></li>
<li><p>If the request is already sent to userspace, then an INTERRUPT
request is queued.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>INTERRUPT requests take precedence over other requests, so the
userspace filesystem will receive queued INTERRUPTs before any others.</p>
<p>The userspace filesystem may ignore the INTERRUPT requests entirely,
or may honor them by sending a reply to the <em>original</em> request, with
the error set to EINTR.</p>
<p>It is also possible that there’s a race between processing the
original request and its INTERRUPT request.  There are two possibilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The INTERRUPT request is processed before the original request is
processed</p></li>
<li><p>The INTERRUPT request is processed after the original request has
been answered</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If the filesystem cannot find the original request, it should wait for
some timeout and/or a number of new requests to arrive, after which it
should reply to the INTERRUPT request with an EAGAIN error.  In case
1) the INTERRUPT request will be requeued.  In case 2) the INTERRUPT
reply will be ignored.</p>

<h2>Aborting a filesystem connection<a class="headerlink" href="#aborting-a-filesystem-connection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to get into certain situations where the filesystem is
not responding.  Reasons for this may be:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Broken userspace filesystem implementation</p></li>
<li><p>Network connection down</p></li>

<p>In either of these cases it may be useful to abort the connection to
the filesystem.  There are several ways to do this:</p>
<blockquote>

<li><p>Kill the filesystem daemon and all users of the filesystem.  Works

<section id="how-do-non-privileged-mounts-work">
<h2>How do non-privileged mounts work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-non-privileged-mounts-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the mount() system call is a privileged operation, a helper
program (fusermount) is needed, which is installed setuid root.</p>
<p>The implication of providing non-privileged mounts is that the mount
owner must not be able to use this capability to compromise the
system.  Obvious requirements arising from this are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>mount owner should not be able to get elevated privileges with the
help of the mounted filesystem</p></li>
<li><p>mount owner should not get illegitimate access to information from
other users’ and the super user’s processes</p></li>
<li><p>mount owner should not be able to induce undesired behavior in
other users’ or the super user’s processes</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="how-are-requirements-fulfilled">
<h2>How are requirements fulfilled?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-requirements-fulfilled" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="upperalpha">
<li><p>The mount owner could gain elevated privileges by either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>creating a filesystem containing a device file, then opening this device</p></li>
<li><p>creating a filesystem containing a suid or sgid application, then executing this application</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The solution is not to allow opening device files and ignore
setuid and setgid bits when executing programs.  To ensure this
fusermount always adds “nosuid” and “nodev” to the mount options
for non-privileged mounts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If another user is accessing files or directories in the
filesystem, the filesystem daemon serving requests can record the
exact sequence and timing of operations performed.  This
information is otherwise inaccessible to the mount owner, so this
counts as an information leak.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem will be presented in point 2) of C).</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are several ways in which the mount owner can induce
undesired behavior in other users’ processes, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p>mounting a filesystem over a file or directory which the mount
owner could otherwise not be able to modify (or could only
make limited modifications).</p>
<p>This is solved in fusermount, by checking the access
permissions on the mountpoint and only allowing the mount if
the mount owner can do unlimited modification (has write
access to the mountpoint, and mountpoint is not a “sticky”
directory)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even if 1) is solved the mount owner can change the behavior
of other users’ processes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>It can slow down or indefinitely delay the execution of a
filesystem operation creating a DoS against the user or the
whole system.  For example a suid application locking a
system file, and then accessing a file on the mount owner’s
filesystem could be stopped, and thus causing the system
file to be locked forever.</p></li>
<li><p>It can present files or directories of unlimited length, or
directory structures of unlimited depth, possibly causing a
system process to eat up diskspace, memory or other
resources, again causing <em>DoS</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The solution to this as well as B) is not to allow processes
to access the filesystem, which could otherwise not be
monitored or manipulated by the mount owner.  Since if the
mount owner can ptrace a process, it can do all of the above
without using a FUSE mount, the same criteria as used in
ptrace can be used to check if a process is allowed to access
the filesystem or not.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>ptrace</em> check is not strictly necessary to
prevent C/2/i, it is enough to check if mount owner has enough
privilege to send signal to the process accessing the
filesystem, since <em>SIGSTOP</em> can be used to get a similar effect.</p>

<h2>I think these limitations are unacceptable?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-think-these-limitations-are-unacceptable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a sysadmin trusts the users enough, or can ensure through other
measures, that system processes will never enter non-privileged
mounts, it can relax the last limitation in several ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>With the ‘user_allow_other’ config option. If this config option is
set, the mounting user can add the ‘allow_other’ mount option which
disables the check for other users’ processes.</p>
<p>User namespaces have an unintuitive interaction with ‘allow_other’:
an unprivileged user - normally restricted from mounting with
‘allow_other’ - could do so in a user namespace where they’re
privileged. If any process could access such an ‘allow_other’ mount
this would give the mounting user the ability to manipulate
processes in user namespaces where they’re unprivileged. For this
reason ‘allow_other’ restricts access to users in the same userns
or a descendant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the ‘allow_sys_admin_access’ module option. If this option is
set, super user’s processes have unrestricted access to mounts
irrespective of allow_other setting or user namespace of the
mounting user.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that both of these relaxations expose the system to potential
information leak or <em>DoS</em> as described in points B and C/2/i-ii in the
preceding section.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways in which to deadlock a FUSE filesystem.
Since we are talking about unprivileged userspace programs,
something must be done about these.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 -  Simple deadlock</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>|  &quot;rm /mnt/fuse/file&quot;               |  FUSE filesystem daemon
|                                    |

|                                    |    *DEADLOCK*
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The solution for this is to allow the filesystem to be aborted.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 - Tricky deadlock</strong></p>
<p>This one needs a carefully crafted filesystem.  It’s a variation on
the above, only the call back to the filesystem is not explicit,
but is caused by a pagefault.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>|  Kamikaze filesystem thread 1      |  Kamikaze filesystem thread 2

|                                    |           [find or create page]
|                                    |           [lock page]
|                                    |           * DEADLOCK *
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The solution is basically the same as above.</p>
<p>An additional problem is that while the write buffer is being copied
to the request, the request must not be interrupted/aborted.  This is
because the destination address of the copy may not be valid after the
request has returned.</p>
<p>This is solved with doing the copy atomically, and allowing abort
while the page(s) belonging to the write buffer are faulted with
get_user_pages().  The ‘req-&gt;locked’ flag indicates when the copy is
taking place, and abort is delayed until this flag is unset.</p>
