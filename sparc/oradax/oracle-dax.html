<h1>Oracle Data Analytics Accelerator (DAX)<a class="headerlink" href="#oracle-data-analytics-accelerator-dax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>DAX is a coprocessor which resides on the SPARC M7 (DAX1) and M8
(DAX2) processor chips, and has direct access to the CPU’s L3 caches
as well as physical memory. It can perform several operations on data
streams with various input and output formats.  A driver provides a
transport mechanism and has limited knowledge of the various opcodes
and data formats. A user space library provides high level services
and translates these into low level commands which are then passed
into the driver and subsequently the Hypervisor and the coprocessor.
The library is the recommended way for applications to use the
coprocessor, and the driver interface is not intended for general use.
This document describes the general flow of the driver, its
structures, and its programmatic interface. It also provides example
code sufficient to write user or kernel applications that use DAX
functionality.</p>
<p>The user library is open source and available at:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://oss.oracle.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libdax.git">https://oss.oracle.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libdax.git</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Hypervisor interface to the coprocessor is described in detail in
the accompanying document, dax-hv-api.txt, which is a plain text
excerpt of the (Oracle internal) “UltraSPARC Virtual Machine
Specification” version 3.0.20+15, dated 2017-09-25.</p>
<section id="high-level-overview">
<h2>High Level Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A coprocessor request is described by a Command Control Block
(CCB). The CCB contains an opcode and various parameters. The opcode
specifies what operation is to be done, and the parameters specify
options, flags, sizes, and addresses.  The CCB (or an array of CCBs)
is passed to the Hypervisor, which handles queueing and scheduling of
requests to the available coprocessor execution units. A status code
returned indicates if the request was submitted successfully or if
there was an error.  One of the addresses given in each CCB is a
pointer to a “completion area”, which is a 128 byte memory block that
is written by the coprocessor to provide execution status. No
interrupt is generated upon completion; the completion area must be
polled by software to find out when a transaction has finished, but
the M7 and later processors provide a mechanism to pause the virtual
processor until the completion status has been updated by the
coprocessor. This is done using the monitored load and mwait
instructions, which are described in more detail later.  The DAX
coprocessor was designed so that after a request is submitted, the
kernel is no longer involved in the processing of it.  The polling is
done at the user level, which results in almost zero latency between
completion of a request and resumption of execution of the requesting
thread.</p>
</section>
<section id="addressing-memory">
<h2>Addressing Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The kernel does not have access to physical memory in the Sun4v
architecture, as there is an additional level of memory virtualization
present. This intermediate level is called “real” memory, and the
kernel treats this as if it were physical.  The Hypervisor handles the
translations between real memory and physical so that each logical
domain (LDOM) can have a partition of physical memory that is isolated
from that of other LDOMs.  When the kernel sets up a virtual mapping,
it specifies a virtual address and the real address to which it should
be mapped.</p>
<p>The DAX coprocessor can only operate on physical memory, so before a
request can be fed to the coprocessor, all the addresses in a CCB must
be converted into physical addresses. The kernel cannot do this since
it has no visibility into physical addresses. So a CCB may contain
either the virtual or real addresses of the buffers or a combination
of them. An “address type” field is available for each address that
may be given in the CCB. In all cases, the Hypervisor will translate
all the addresses to physical before dispatching to hardware. Address
translations are performed using the context of the process initiating
the request.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-driver-api">
<h2>The Driver API<a class="headerlink" href="#the-driver-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An application makes requests to the driver via the write() system
call, and gets results (if any) via read(). The completion areas are
made accessible via mmap(), and are read-only for the application.</p>
<p>The request may either be an immediate command or an array of CCBs to
be submitted to the hardware.</p>
<p>Each open instance of the device is exclusive to the thread that
opened it, and must be used by that thread for all subsequent
operations. The driver open function creates a new context for the
thread and initializes it for use.  This context contains pointers and
values used internally by the driver to keep track of submitted
requests. The completion area buffer is also allocated, and this is
large enough to contain the completion areas for many concurrent
requests.  When the device is closed, any outstanding transactions are
flushed and the context is cleaned up.</p>
<p>On a DAX1 system (M7), the device will be called “oradax1”, while on a
DAX2 system (M8) it will be “oradax2”. If an application requires one
or the other, it should simply attempt to open the appropriate
device. Only one of the devices will exist on any given system, so the
name can be used to determine what the platform supports.</p>
<p>The immediate commands are CCB_DEQUEUE, CCB_KILL, and CCB_INFO. For
all of these, success is indicated by a return value from write()
equal to the number of bytes given in the call. Otherwise -1 is
returned and errno is set.</p>
<section id="ccb-dequeue">
<h3>CCB_DEQUEUE<a class="headerlink" href="#ccb-dequeue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tells the driver to clean up resources associated with past
requests. Since no interrupt is generated upon the completion of a
request, the driver must be told when it may reclaim resources.  No
further status information is returned, so the user should not
subsequently call read().</p>
</section>
<section id="ccb-kill">
<h3>CCB_KILL<a class="headerlink" href="#ccb-kill" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kills a CCB during execution. The CCB is guaranteed to not continue
executing once this call returns successfully. On success, read() must
be called to retrieve the result of the action.</p>
</section>
<section id="ccb-info">
<h3>CCB_INFO<a class="headerlink" href="#ccb-info" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Retrieves information about a currently executing CCB. Note that some
Hypervisors might return ‘notfound’ when the CCB is in ‘inprogress’
state. To ensure a CCB in the ‘notfound’ state will never be executed,
CCB_KILL must be invoked on that CCB. Upon success, read() must be
called to retrieve the details of the action.</p>
</section>
<section id="submission-of-an-array-of-ccbs-for-execution">
<h3>Submission of an array of CCBs for execution<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-of-an-array-of-ccbs-for-execution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A write() whose length is a multiple of the CCB size is treated as a
submit operation. The file offset is treated as the index of the
completion area to use, and may be set via lseek() or using the
pwrite() system call. If -1 is returned then errno is set to indicate
the error. Otherwise, the return value is the length of the array that
was actually accepted by the coprocessor. If the accepted length is
equal to the requested length, then the submission was completely
successful and there is no further status needed; hence, the user
should not subsequently call read(). Partial acceptance of the CCB
array is indicated by a return value less than the requested length,
and read() must be called to retrieve further status information.  The
status will reflect the error caused by the first CCB that was not
accepted, and status_data will provide additional data in some cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="mmap">
<h3>MMAP<a class="headerlink" href="#mmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mmap() function provides access to the completion area allocated
in the driver.  Note that the completion area is not writeable by the
user process, and the mmap call must not specify PROT_WRITE.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="completion-of-a-request">
<h2>Completion of a Request<a class="headerlink" href="#completion-of-a-request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first byte in each completion area is the command status which is
updated by the coprocessor hardware. Software may take advantage of
new M7/M8 processor capabilities to efficiently poll this status byte.
First, a “monitored load” is achieved via a Load from Alternate Space
(ldxa, lduba, etc.) with ASI 0x84 (ASI_MONITOR_PRIMARY).  Second, a
“monitored wait” is achieved via the mwait instruction (a write to
%asr28). This instruction is like pause in that it suspends execution
of the virtual processor for the given number of nanoseconds, but in
addition will terminate early when one of several events occur. If the
block of data containing the monitored location is modified, then the
mwait terminates. This causes software to resume execution immediately
(without a context switch or kernel to user transition) after a
transaction completes. Thus the latency between transaction completion
and resumption of execution may be just a few nanoseconds.</p>

<section id="memory-constraints">
<h2>Memory Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DAX hardware operates only on physical addresses. Therefore, it is
not aware of virtual memory mappings and the discontiguities that may
exist in the physical memory that a virtual buffer maps to. There is
no I/O TLB or any scatter/gather mechanism. All buffers, whether input
or output, must reside in a physically contiguous region of memory.</p>
<p>The Hypervisor translates all addresses within a CCB to physical
before handing off the CCB to DAX. The Hypervisor determines the
virtual page size for each virtual address given, and uses this to
program a size limit for each address. This prevents the coprocessor
from reading or writing beyond the bound of the virtual page, even
though it is accessing physical memory directly. A simpler way of
saying this is that a DAX operation will never “cross” a virtual page
boundary. If an 8k virtual page is used, then the data is strictly
limited to 8k. If a user’s buffer is larger than 8k, then a larger
page size must be used, or the transaction size will be truncated to
8k.</p>
<p>Huge pages. A user may allocate huge pages using standard interfaces.
Memory buffers residing on huge pages may be used to achieve much
larger DAX transaction sizes, but the rules must still be followed,
and no transaction will cross a page boundary, even a huge page.  A
major caveat is that Linux on Sparc presents 8Mb as one of the huge
page sizes. Sparc does not actually provide a 8Mb hardware page size,
and this size is synthesized by pasting together two 4Mb pages. The
reasons for this are historical, and it creates an issue because only
half of this 8Mb page can actually be used for any given buffer in a
DAX request, and it must be either the first half or the second half;
it cannot be a 4Mb chunk in the middle, since that crosses a
(hardware) page boundary. Note that this entire issue may be hidden by
higher level libraries.</p>
<section id="ccb-structure">
<h3>CCB Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#ccb-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A CCB is an array of 8 64-bit words. Several of these words provide
command opcodes, parameters, flags, etc., and the rest are addresses
for the completion area, output buffer, and various inputs:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>struct ccb {
    u64   control;
    u64   completion;
    u64   input0;
    u64   access;
    u64   input1;
    u64   op_data;
    u64   output;
    u64   table;
};
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>See libdax/common/sys/dax1/dax1_ccb.h for a detailed description of
each of these fields, and see dax-hv-api.txt for a complete description
of the Hypervisor API available to the guest OS (ie, Linux kernel).</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The first word (control) is examined by the driver for the following:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>CCB version, which must be consistent with hardware version</p></li>
<li><p>Opcode, which must be one of the documented allowable commands</p></li>
<li><p>Address types, which must be set to “virtual” for all the addresses

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section id="example-code">
<h2>Example Code<a class="headerlink" href="#example-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DAX is accessible to both user and kernel code.  The kernel code
can make hypercalls directly while the user code must use wrappers
provided by the driver. The setup of the CCB is nearly identical for
both; the only difference is in preparation of the completion area. An
example of user code is given now, with kernel code afterwards.</p>
<p>In order to program using the driver API, the file
arch/sparc/include/uapi/asm/oradax.h must be included.</p>
<p>First, the proper device must be opened. For M7 it will be
/dev/oradax1 and for M8 it will be /dev/oradax2. The simplest
procedure is to attempt to open both, as only one will succeed:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>fd = open(&quot;/dev/oradax1&quot;, O_RDWR);
if (fd &lt; 0)
        fd = open(&quot;/dev/oradax2&quot;, O_RDWR);
if (fd &lt; 0)
       /* No DAX found */
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, the completion area must be mapped:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>completion_area = mmap(NULL, DAX_MMAP_LEN, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All input and output buffers must be fully contained in one hardware
page, since as explained above, the DAX is strictly constrained by
virtual page boundaries.  In addition, the output buffer must be
64-byte aligned and its size must be a multiple of 64 bytes because
the coprocessor writes in units of cache lines.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the DAX Scan command, which takes as input a
vector and a match value, and produces a bitmap as the output. For
each input element that matches the value, the corresponding bit is
set in the output.</p>
<p>In this example, the input vector consists of a series of single bits,
and the match value is 0. So each 0 bit in the input will produce a 1
in the output, and vice versa, which produces an output bitmap which
is the input bitmap inverted.</p>
<p>For details of all the parameters and bits used in this CCB, please
refer to section 36.2.1.3 of the DAX Hypervisor API document, which
describes the Scan command in detail:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ccb-&gt;control =       /* Table 36.1, CCB Header Format */
          (2L &lt;&lt; 48)     /* command = Scan Value */

        | (1 &lt;&lt; 28)     /* 36.2.1.1.1 primary input format = fixed width bit packed */
        | (0 &lt;&lt; 23)     /* 36.2.1.1.2 primary input element size = 0 (1 bit) */
        | (8 &lt;&lt; 10)     /* 36.2.1.1.6 output format = bit vector */
        | (0 &lt;&lt;  5)     /* 36.2.1.3 First scan criteria size = 0 (1 byte) */
        | (31 &lt;&lt; 0);    /* 36.2.1.3 Disable second scan criteria */

ccb-&gt;completion = 0;    /* Completion area address, to be filled in by driver */

ccb-&gt;input0 = (unsigned long) input; /* primary input address */

ccb-&gt;access =       /* Section 36.2.1.2, Data Access Control */
          (2 &lt;&lt; 24)    /* Primary input length format = bits */
        | (nbits - 1); /* number of bits in primary input stream, minus 1 */

ccb-&gt;input1 = 0;       /* secondary input address, unused */

ccb-&gt;op_data = 0;      /* scan criteria (value to be matched) */

ccb-&gt;output = (unsigned long) output;   /* output address */

ccb-&gt;table = 0;        /* table address, unused */
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The CCB submission is a write() or pwrite() system call to the
driver. If the call fails, then a read() must be used to retrieve the
status:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (pwrite(fd, ccb, 64, 0) != 64) {
        struct ccb_exec_result status;
        read(fd, &amp;status, sizeof(status));
        /* bail out */
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After a successful submission of the CCB, the completion area may be
polled to determine when the DAX is finished. Detailed information on
the contents of the completion area can be found in section 36.2.2 of
the DAX HV API document:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>while (1) {
        /* Monitored Load */
        __asm__ __volatile__(&quot;lduba [%1] 0x84, %0\n&quot;
                             : &quot;=r&quot; (status)
                             : &quot;r&quot;  (completion_area));

        if (status)          /* 0 indicates command in progress */
                break;

        /* MWAIT */
        __asm__ __volatile__(&quot;wr %%g0, 1000, %%asr28\n&quot; ::);    /* 1000 ns */
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A completion area status of 1 indicates successful completion of the
CCB and validity of the output bitmap, which may be used immediately.
All other non-zero values indicate error conditions which are
described in section 36.2.2:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (completion_area[0] != 1) {  /* section 36.2.2, 1 = command ran and succeeded */
        /* completion_area[0] contains the completion status */
        /* completion_area[1] contains an error code, see 36.2.2 */
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After the completion area has been processed, the driver must be
notified that it can release any resources associated with the
request. This is done via the dequeue operation:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>struct dax_command cmd;
cmd.command = CCB_DEQUEUE;
if (write(fd, &amp;cmd, sizeof(cmd)) != sizeof(cmd)) {
        /* bail out */
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, normal program cleanup should be done, i.e., unmapping
completion area, closing the dax device, freeing memory etc.</p>
<section id="kernel-example">
<h3>Kernel example<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The only difference in using the DAX in kernel code is the treatment
of the completion area. Unlike user applications which mmap the
completion area allocated by the driver, kernel code must allocate its
own memory to use for the completion area, and this address and its
type must be given in the CCB:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ccb-&gt;control |=      /* Table 36.1, CCB Header Format */
        (3L &lt;&lt; 32);     /* completion area address type = primary virtual */

ccb-&gt;completion = (unsigned long) completion_area;   /* Completion area address */
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The dax submit hypercall is made directly. The flags used in the
ccb_submit call are documented in the DAX HV API in section 36.3.1/</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#include &lt;asm/hypervisor.h&gt;

      }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After the submission, the completion area polling code is identical to

        /* completion_area[1] contains an error code, see 36.2.2 */

Chapter 36. Coprocessor services
        The following APIs provide access via the Hypervisor to hardware assisted data processing functionality.
        These APIs may only be provided by certain platforms, and may not be available to all virtual machines
        even on supported platforms. Restrictions on the use of these APIs may be imposed in order to support
        live-migration and other system management activities.

36.1. Data Analytics Accelerator
        The Data Analytics Accelerator (DAX) functionality is a collection of hardware coprocessors that provide
        high speed processoring of database-centric operations. The coprocessors may support one or more of
        the following data query operations: search, extraction, compression, decompression, and translation. The
        functionality offered may vary by virtual machine implementation.

        The DAX is a virtual device to sun4v guests, with supported data operations indicated by the virtual device
        compatibilty property. Functionality is accessed through the submission of Command Control Blocks
        (CCBs) via the ccb_submit API function. The operations are processed asynchronously, with the status
        of the submitted operations reported through a Completion Area linked to each CCB. Each CCB has a
        separate Completion Area and, unless execution order is specifically restricted through the use of serial-
        conditional flags, the execution order of submitted CCBs is arbitrary. Likewise, the time to completion
        for a given CCB is never guaranteed.

        Guest software may implement a software timeout on CCB operations, and if the timeout is exceeded, the
        operation may be cancelled or killed via the ccb_kill API function. It is recommended for guest software
        to implement a software timeout to account for certain RAS errors which may result in lost CCBs. It is
        recommended such implementation use the ccb_info API function to check the status of a CCB prior to
        killing it in order to determine if the CCB is still in queue, or may have been lost due to a RAS error.

        There is no fixed limit on the number of outstanding CCBs guest software may have queued in the virtual
        machine, however, internal resource limitations within the virtual machine can cause CCB submissions
        to be temporarily rejected with EWOULDBLOCK. In such cases, guests should continue to attempt
        submissions until they succeed; waiting for an outstanding CCB to complete is not necessary, and would
        not be a guarantee that a future submission would succeed.

        The availablility of DAX coprocessor command service is indicated by the presence of the DAX virtual
        device node in the guest MD (Section 8.24.17, “Database Analytics Accelerators (DAX) virtual-device
        node”).

36.1.1. DAX Compatibility Property
        The query functionality may vary based on the compatibility property of the virtual device:

        Version 0 and 1 CCBs are available. Only version 0 CCBs may use Huffman encoded data, whereas only
        version 1 CCBs may use OZIP.

36.1.2. DAX Virtual Device Interrupts
        The DAX virtual device has multiple interrupts associated with it which may be used by the guest if
        desired. The number of device interrupts available to the guest is indicated in the virtual device node of the
        guest MD (Section 8.24.17, “Database Analytics Accelerators (DAX) virtual-device node”). If the device
        node indicates N interrupts available, the guest may use any value from 0 to N - 1 (inclusive) in a CCB
        interrupt number field. Using values outside this range will result in the CCB being rejected for an invalid
        field value.

        The interrupts may be bound and managed using the standard sun4v device interrupts API (Chapter 16,
        Device interrupt services). Sysino interrupts are not available for DAX devices.

36.2. Coprocessor Control Block (CCB)
        CCBs are either 64 or 128 bytes long, depending on the operation type. The exact contents of the CCB
        are command specific, but all CCBs contain at least one memory buffer address. All memory locations


                                                      510

referenced by a CCB must be pinned in memory until the CCB either completes execution or is killed
via the ccb_kill API call. Changes in virtual address mappings occurring after CCB submission are not
guaranteed to be visible, and as such all virtual address updates need to be synchronized with CCB
execution.

All CCBs begin with a common 32-bit header.

The Long CCB flag indicates whether the submitted CCB is 64 or 128 bytes long; value is 0 for 64 bytes
and 1 for 128 bytes.

The Serial and Conditional flags allow simple relative ordering between CCBs. Any CCB with the Serial
flag set will execute sequentially relative to any previous CCB that is also marked as Serial in the same
CCB submission. CCBs without the Serial flag set execute independently, even if they are between CCBs
with the Serial flag set. CCBs marked solely with the Serial flag will execute upon the completion of the
previous Serial CCB, regardless of the completion status of that CCB. The Conditional flag allows CCBs
to conditionally execute based on the successful execution of the closest CCB marked with the Serial flag.
A CCB may only be conditional on exactly one CCB, however, a CCB may be marked both Conditional
and Serial to allow execution chaining. The flags do NOT allow fan-out chaining, where multiple CCBs
execute in parallel based on the completion of another CCB.

The Pipeline flag is an optimization that directs the output of one CCB (the &quot;source&quot; CCB) directly to
the input of the next CCB (the &quot;target&quot; CCB). The target CCB thus does not need to read the input from
memory. The Pipeline flag is advisory and may be dropped.

Both the Pipeline and Serial bits must be set in the source CCB. The Conditional bit must be set in the
target CCB. Exactly one CCB must be made conditional on the source CCB; either 0 or 2 target CCBs
is invalid. However, Pipelines can be extended beyond two CCBs: the sequence would start with a CCB
with both the Pipeline and Serial bits set, proceed through CCBs with the Pipeline, Serial, and Conditional
bits set, and terminate at a CCB that has the Conditional bit set, but not the Pipeline bit.

          The input of the target CCB must start within 64 bytes of the output of the source CCB or the pipeline flag
          will be ignored. All CCBs in a pipeline must be submitted in the same call to ccb_submit.

          The various address type fields indicate how the various address values used in the CCB should be
          interpreted by the virtual machine. Not all of the types specified are used by every CCB format. Types
          which are not applicable to the given CCB command should be indicated as type 0 (No address). Virtual
          addresses used in the CCB must have translation entries present in either the TLB or a configured TSB
          for the submitting virtual processor. Virtual addresses which cannot be translated by the virtual machine
          will result in the CCB submission being rejected, with the causal virtual address indicated. The CCB
          may be resubmitted after inserting the translation, or the address may be translated by guest software and
          resubmitted using the real address translation.

36.2.1. Query CCB Command Formats
36.2.1.1. Supported Data Formats, Elements Sizes and Offsets
          Data for query commands may be encoded in multiple possible formats. The data query commands use a
          common set of values to indicate the encoding formats of the data being processed. Some encoding formats
          require multiple data streams for processing, requiring the specification of both primary data formats (the
          encoded data) and secondary data streams (meta-data for the encoded data).

36.2.1.1.1. Primary Input Format

          The primary input format code is a 4-bit field when it is used. There are 10 primary input formats available.
          The packed formats are not endian neutral. Code values not listed below are reserved.

          Code        Format                              Description

          If OZIP encoding is used, there must be no reserved bytes in the table.

36.2.1.1.2. Primary Input Element Size

          For primary input data streams with fixed size elements, the element size must be indicated in the CCB
          command. The size is encoded as the number of bits or bytes, minus one. The valid value range for this
          field depends on the input format selected, as listed in the table above.

36.2.1.1.3. Secondary Input Format

          For primary input data streams which require a secondary input stream, the secondary input stream is
          always encoded in a fixed width, bit-packed format. The bits are read from most significant bit to least
          significant bit within a byte. There are two encoding options for the secondary input stream data elements,
          depending on whether the value of 0 is needed:

          Secondary           Input Description
          Format Code
          0                          Element is stored as value minus 1 (0 evalutes to 1, 1 evalutes
                                     to 2, etc)
          1                          Element is stored as value

36.2.1.1.4. Secondary Input Element Size

          Secondary input element size is encoded as a two bit field:

          Secondary Input Size Description
          Code
          0x0                        1 bit
          0x1                        2 bits
          0x2                        4 bits
          0x3                        8 bits

36.2.1.1.5. Input Element Offsets

          Bit-wise input data streams may have any alignment within the base addressed byte. The offset, specified
          from most significant bit to least significant bit, is provided as a fixed 3 bit field for each input type. A
          value of 0 indicates that the first input element begins at the most significant bit in the first byte, and a
          value of 7 indicates it begins with the least significant bit.

          This field should be zero for any byte-wise primary input data streams.

36.2.1.1.6. Output Format

          Query commands support multiple sizes and encodings for output data streams. There are four possible
          output encodings, and up to four supported element sizes per encoding. Not all output encodings are
          supported for every command. The format is indicated by a 4-bit field in the CCB:

36.2.1.1.7. Application Data Integrity (ADI)

          On platforms which support ADI, the ADI version number may be specified for each separate memory
          access type used in the CCB command. ADI checking only occurs when reading data. When writing data,
          the specified ADI version number overwrites any existing ADI value in memory.

          An ADI version value of 0 or 0xF indicates the ADI checking is disabled for that data access, even if it is
          enabled in memory. By setting the appropriate flag in CCB_SUBMIT (Section 36.3.1, “ccb_submit”) it is
          also an option to disable ADI checking for all inputs accessed via virtual address for all CCBs submitted
          during that hypercall invocation.

          The ADI value is only guaranteed to be checked on the first 64 bytes of each data access. Mismatches on
          subsequent data chunks may not be detected, so guest software should be careful to use page size checking
          to protect against buffer overruns.

36.2.1.1.8. Page size checking

          All data accesses used in CCB commands must be bounded within a single memory page. When addresses
          are provided using a virtual address, the page size for checking is extracted from the TTE for that virtual
          address. When using real addresses, the guest must supply the page size in the same field as the address
          value. The page size must be one of the sizes supported by the underlying virtual machine. Using a value
          that is not supported may result in the CCB submission being rejected or the generation of a CCB parsing
          error in the completion area.

36.2.1.2. Extract command

        Converts an input vector in one format to an output vector in another format. All input format types are
        supported.

        The only supported output format is a padded, byte-aligned output stream, using output codes 0x0 - 0x4.
        When the specified output element size is larger than the extracted input element size, zeros are padded to
        the extracted input element. First, if the decompressed input size is not a whole number of bytes, 0 bits are
        padded to the most significant bit side till the next byte boundary. Next, if the output element size is larger
        than the byte padded input element, bytes of value 0 are added based on the Padding Direction bit in the
        CCB. If the output element size is smaller than the byte-padded input element size, the input element is
        truncated by dropped from the least significant byte side until the selected output size is reached.

        The return value of the CCB completion area is invalid. The “number of elements processed” field in the
        CCB completion area will be valid.

        The extract CCB is a 64-byte “short format” CCB.

        The extract CCB command format can be specified by the following packed C structure for a big-endian
        machine:


                  struct extract_ccb {
                         uint32_t header;
                         uint32_t control;
                         uint64_t completion;
                         uint64_t primary_input;
                         uint64_t data_access_control;
                         uint64_t secondary_input;
                         uint64_t reserved;
                         uint64_t output;
                         uint64_t table;
                  };

36.2.1.3. Scan commands

        The scan commands search a stream of input data elements for values which match the selection criteria.
        All the input format types are supported. There are multiple formats for the scan commands, allowing the
        scan to search for exact matches to one value, exact matches to either of two values, or any value within
        a specified range. The specific type of scan is indicated by the command code in the CCB header. For the
        scan range commands, the boundary conditions can be specified as greater-than-or-equal-to a value, less-
        than-or-equal-to a value, or both by using two boundary values.

        There are two supported formats for the output stream: the bit vector and index array formats (codes 0x8,
        0xD, and 0xE). For the standard scan command using the bit vector output, for each input element there
        exists one bit in the vector that is set if the input element matched the scan criteria, or clear if not. The
        inverted scan command inverts the polarity of the bits in the output. The most significant bit of the first
        byte of the output stream corresponds to the first element in the input stream. The standard index array
        output format contains one array entry for each input element that matched the scan criteria. Each array



                                                         519
                                       Coprocessor services


entry is the index of an input element that matched the scan criteria. An inverted scan command produces
a similar array, but of all the input elements which did NOT match the scan criteria.

The return value of the CCB completion area contains the number of input elements found which match
the scan criteria (or number that did not match for the inverted scans). The “number of elements processed”
field in the CCB completion area will be valid, indicating the number of input elements processed.

These commands are 128-byte “long format” CCBs.

The scan CCB command format can be specified by the following packed C structure for a big-endian
machine:


         struct scan_ccb         {
                uint32_t         header;
                uint32_t         control;
                uint64_t         completion;
                uint64_t         primary_input;
                uint64_t         data_access_control;
                uint64_t         secondary_input;
                uint64_t         match_criteria0;
                uint64_t         output;
                uint64_t         table;
                uint64_t         match_criteria1;
                uint64_t         match_criteria2;
                uint64_t         match_criteria3;
                uint64_t         reserved[5];
         };

36.2.1.4. Translate commands

        The translate commands takes an input array of indicies, and a table of single bit values indexed by those
        indicies, and outputs a bit vector or index array created by reading the tables bit value at each index in
        the input array. The output should therefore contain exactly one bit per index in the input data stream,
        when outputing as a bit vector. When outputing as an index array, the number of elements depends on the
        values read in the bit table, but will always be less than, or equal to, the number of input elements. Only
        a restricted subset of the possible input format types are supported. No variable width or Huffman/OZIP
        encoded input streams are allowed. The primary input data element size must be 3 bytes or less.

        The maximum table index size allowed is 15 bits, however, larger input elements may be used to provide
        additional processing of the output values. If 2 or 3 byte values are used, the least significant 15 bits are
        used as an index into the bit table. The most significant 9 bits (when using 3-byte input elements) or single
        bit (when using 2-byte input elements) are compared against a fixed 9-bit test value provided in the CCB.
        If the values match, the value from the bit table is used as the output element value. If the values do not
        match, the output data element value is forced to 0.

        In the inverted translate operation, the bit value read from bit table is inverted prior to its use. The additional
        additional processing based on any additional non-index bits remains unchanged, and still forces the output
        element value to 0 on a mismatch. The specific type of translate command is indicated by the command
        code in the CCB header.

        There are two supported formats for the output stream: the bit vector and index array formats (codes 0x8,
        0xD, and 0xE). The index array format is an array of indicies of bits which would have been set if the
        output format was a bit array.

        The return value of the CCB completion area contains the number of bits set in the output bit vector,
        or number of elements in the output index array. The “number of elements processed” field in the CCB
        completion area will be valid, indicating the number of input elements processed.

        These commands are 64-byte “short format” CCBs.

        The translate CCB command format can be specified by the following packed C structure for a big-endian
        machine:


                 struct translate_ccb {
                        uint32_t header;
                        uint32_t control;
                        uint64_t completion;

36.2.1.5. Select command
        The select command filters the primary input data stream by using a secondary input bit vector to determine
        which input elements to include in the output. For each bit set at a given index N within the bit vector,
        the Nth input element is included in the output. If the bit is not set, the element is not included. Only a
        restricted subset of the possible input format types are supported. No variable width or run length encoded
        input streams are allowed, since the secondary input stream is used for the filtering bit vector.

        The only supported output format is a padded, byte-aligned output stream. The stream follows the same
        rules and restrictions as padded output stream described in Section 36.2.1.2, “Extract command”.

        The return value of the CCB completion area contains the number of bits set in the input bit vector. The
        &quot;number of elements processed&quot; field in the CCB completion area will be valid, indicating the number
        of input elements processed.

        The select CCB is a 64-byte “short format” CCB.

        The select CCB command format can be specified by the following packed C structure for a big-endian
        machine:


                  struct select_ccb {

36.2.1.6. No-op and Sync commands
        The no-op (no operation) command is a CCB which has no processing effect. The CCB, when processed
        by the virtual machine, simply updates the completion area with its execution status. The CCB may have
        the serial-conditional flags set in order to restrict when it executes.

        The sync command is a variant of the no-op command which with restricted execution timing. A sync
        command CCB will only execute when all previous commands submitted in the same request have
        completed. This is stronger than the conditional flag sequencing, which is only dependent on a single
        previous serial CCB. While the relative ordering is guaranteed, virtual machine implementations with
        shared hardware resources may cause the sync command to wait for longer than the minimum required
        time.

        The return value of the CCB completion area is invalid for these CCBs. The “number of elements
        processed” field is also invalid for these CCBs.

        These commands are 64-byte “short format” CCBs.

        The no-op CCB command format can be specified by the following packed C structure for a big-endian
        machine:


                 struct nop_ccb {
                        uint32_t header;
                        uint32_t control;
                        uint64_t completion;
                        uint64_t reserved[6];
                 };

36.2.2. CCB Completion Area
       All CCB commands use a common 128-byte Completion Area format, which can be specified by the
       following packed C structure for a big-endian machine:


                struct completion_area {
                       uint8_t status_flag;
                       uint8_t error_note;
                       uint8_t rsvd0[2];
                       uint32_t error_values;
                       uint32_t output_size;
                       uint32_t rsvd1;
                       uint64_t run_time;
                       uint64_t run_stats;
                       uint32_t elements;
                       uint8_t rsvd2[20];
                       uint64_t return_value;
                       uint64_t extra_return_value[8];
                };


       The Completion Area must be a 128-byte aligned memory location. The exact layout can be described
       using byte offsets and sizes relative to the memory base:

       Offset        Size          Field Description

The CCB completion area should be treated as read-only by guest software. The CCB execution status
byte will be cleared by the Hypervisor to reflect the pending execution status when the CCB is submitted
successfully. All other fields are considered invalid upon CCB submission until the CCB execution status
byte becomes non-zero.

CCBs which complete with status 0x2 or 0x3 may produce partial results and/or side effects due to partial
execution of the CCB command. Some valid data may be accessible depending on the fault type, however,
it is recommended that guest software treat the destination buffer as being in an unknown state. If a CCB
completes with a status byte of 0x2, the error reason code byte can be read to determine what corrective
action should be taken.

A buffer overflow indicates that the results of the operation exceeded the size of the output buffer indicated
in the CCB. The operation can be retried by resubmitting the CCB with a larger output buffer.

A CCB decoding error indicates that the CCB contained some invalid field values. It may be also be
triggered if the CCB output is directed at a non-existent secondary input and the pipelining hint is followed.

A page overflow error indicates that the operation required accessing a memory location beyond the page
size associated with a given address. No data will have been read or written past the page boundary, but
partial results may have been written to the destination buffer. The CCB can be resubmitted with a larger
page size memory allocation to complete the operation.

                                            Coprocessor services


       In the case of pipelined CCBs, a page overflow error will be triggered if the output from the pipeline source
       CCB ends before the input of the pipeline target CCB. Page boundaries are ignored when the pipeline
       hint is followed.

       Command kill indicates that the CCB execution was halted or prevented by use of the ccb_kill API call.

       Command timeout indicates that the CCB execution began, but did not complete within a pre-determined
       limit set by the virtual machine. The command may have produced some or no output. The CCB may be
       resubmitted with no alterations.

       ADI miscompare indicates that the memory buffer version specified in the CCB did not match the value
       in memory when accessed by the virtual machine. Guest software should not attempt to resubmit the CCB
       without determining the cause of the version mismatch.

       A data format error indicates that the input data stream did not follow the specified data input formatting
       selected in the CCB.

       Some CCBs which encounter hardware errors may be resubmitted without change. Persistent hardware
       errors may result in multiple failures until RAS software can identify and isolate the faulty component.

       The output size field indicates the number of bytes of valid output in the destination buffer. This field is
       not valid for all possible CCB commands.

       The runtime field indicates the execution time of the CCB command once it leaves the internal virtual
       machine queue. The time units are fixed, but unspecified, allowing only relative timing comparisons
       by guest software. The time units may also vary by hardware platform, and should not be construed to
       represent any absolute time value.

       Some data query commands process data in units of elements. If applicable to the command, the number of
       elements processed is indicated in the listed field. This field is not valid for all possible CCB commands.

       The return value and extended return value fields are output locations for commands which do not use
       a destination output buffer, or have secondary return results. The field is not valid for all possible CCB
       commands.

       Submit one or more coprocessor control blocks (CCBs) for evaluation and processing by the virtual
       machine. The CCBs are passed in a linear array indicated by address. length indicates the size of
       the array in bytes.

The address should be aligned to the size indicated by length, rounded up to the nearest power of
two. Virtual machines implementations may reject submissions which do not adhere to that alignment.
length must be a multiple of 64 bytes. If length is zero, the maximum supported array length will be
returned as length in ret1. In all other cases, the length value in ret1 will reflect the number of bytes
successfully consumed from the input CCB array.

      Implementation note
      Virtual machines should never reject submissions based on the alignment of address if the
      entire array is contained within a single memory page of the smallest page size supported by the
      virtual machine.

A guest may choose to submit addresses used in this API function, including the CCB array address,
as either a real or virtual addresses, with the type of each address indicated in flags. Virtual addresses
must be present in either the TLB or an active TSB to be processed. The translation context for virtual
addresses is determined by a combination of CCB contents and the flags argument.

The flags argument is divided into multiple fields defined as follows:

         The CCB submission type and address type for the CCB array must be provided in the flags argument.
         All other fields are optional values which change the default behavior of the CCB processing.

         When set to one, the &quot;Disable ADI for VA reads&quot; bit will turn off ADI checking when using a virtual
         address to load data. ADI checking will still be done when loading real-addressed memory. This bit is only
         available when using major version 2 of the coprocessor API group; at major version 1 it is reserved. For
         more information about using ADI and DAX, see Section 36.2.1.1.7, “Application Data Integrity (ADI)”.

         By default, all virtual addresses are treated as user addresses. If the virtual address translations are
         privileged, they must be marked as such in the appropriate flags field. The virtual addresses used within
         the submitted CCBs must all be translated with the same privilege level.

         By default, all virtual addresses used within the submitted CCBs are translated using the primary context
         active at the time of the submission. The address type field within a CCB allows each address to request
         translation in an alternate address context. The address context used when the alternate address context is
         requested is selected in the flags argument.

         The all-or-nothing flag specifies whether the virtual machine should allow partial submissions of the
         input CCB array. When using CCBs with serial-conditional flags, it is strongly recommended to use
         the all-or-nothing flag to avoid broken conditional chains. Using long CCB chains on a machine under
         high coprocessor load may make this impractical, however, and require submitting without the flag.
         When submitting serial-conditional CCBs without the all-or-nothing flag, guest software must manually
         implement the serial-conditional behavior at any point where the chain was not submitted in a single API
         call, and resubmission of the remaining CCBs should clear any conditional flag that might be set in the
         first remaining CCB. Failure to do so will produce indeterminate CCB execution status and ordering.

         When the all-or-nothing flag is not specified, callers should check the value of length in ret1 to determine
         how many CCBs from the array were successfully submitted. Any remaining CCBs can be resubmitted
         without modifications.

         The value of length in ret1 is also valid when the API call returns an error, and callers should always
         check its value to determine which CCBs in the array were already processed. This will additionally
         identify which CCB encountered the processing error, and was not submitted successfully.

         If the queue info flag is used during submission, and at least one CCB was successfully submitted, the
         length value in ret1 will be a multi-field value defined as follows:
          Bits          Field Description
          [63:48]       DAX unit instance identifier
          [47:32]       DAX queue instance identifier
          [31:16]       Reserved
          [15:0]        Number of CCB bytes successfully submitted

         The value of status data depends on the status value. See error status code descriptions for details.
         The value is undefined for status values that do not specifically list a value for the status data.

         The API has a reserved input and output register which will be used in subsequent minor versions of this
         API function. Guest software implementations should treat that register as voltile across the function call
         in order to maintain forward compatibility.

36.3.1.1. Errors
          EOK                       One or more CCBs have been accepted and enqueued in the virtual machine
                                    and no errors were been encountered during submission. Some submitted
                                    CCBs may not have been enqueued due to internal virtual machine limitations,
                                    and may be resubmitted without changes.

EWOULDBLOCK    An internal resource conflict within the virtual machine has prevented it from
               being able to complete the CCB submissions sufficiently quickly, requiring
               it to abandon processing before it was complete. Some CCBs may have been
               successfully enqueued prior to the block, and all remaining CCBs may be
               resubmitted without changes.
EBADALIGN      CCB array is not on a 64-byte boundary, or the array length is not a multiple
               of 64 bytes.
ENORADDR       A real address used either for the CCB array, or within one of the submitted
               CCBs, is not valid for the guest. Some CCBs may have been enqueued prior
               to the error being detected.
ENOMAP         A virtual address used either for the CCB array, or within one of the submitted
               CCBs, could not be translated by the virtual machine using either the TLB
               or TSB contents. The submission may be retried after adding the required
               mapping, or by converting the virtual address into a real address. Due to the
               shared nature of address translation resources, there is no theoretical limit on
               the number of times the translation may fail, and it is recommended all guests
               implement some real address based backup. The virtual address which failed
               translation is returned as status data in ret2. Some CCBs may have been
               enqueued prior to the error being detected.
EINVAL         The virtual machine detected an invalid CCB during submission, or invalid
               input arguments, such as bad flag values. Note that not all invalid CCB values
               will be detected during submission, and some may be reported as errors in the
               completion area instead. Some CCBs may have been enqueued prior to the
               error being detected. This error may be returned if the CCB version is invalid.
ETOOMANY       The request was submitted with the all-or-nothing flag set, and the array size is
               greater than the virtual machine can support in a single request. The maximum
               supported size for the current virtual machine can be queried by submitting a
               request with a zero length array, as described above.
ENOACCESS      The guest does not have permission to submit CCBs, or an address used in a
               CCBs lacks sufficient permissions to perform the required operation (no write
               permission on the destination buffer address, for example). A virtual address
               which fails permission checking is returned as status data in ret2. Some
               CCBs may have been enqueued prior to the error being detected.
EUNAVAILABLE   The requested CCB operation could not be performed at this time. The
               restricted operation availability may apply only to the first unsuccessfully
               submitted CCB, or may apply to a larger scope. The status should not be
               interpreted as permanent, and the guest should attempt to submit CCBs in
               the future which had previously been unable to be performed. The status
               data provides additional information about scope of the retricted availability
               as follows:
               Value       Description
               0           Processing for the exact CCB instance submitted was unavailable,
                           and it is recommended the guest emulate the operation. The
                           guest should continue to submit all other CCBs, and assume no
                           restrictions beyond this exact CCB instance.
               1           Processing is unavailable for all CCBs using the requested opcode,
                           and it is recommended the guest emulate the operation. The
                           guest should continue to submit all other CCBs that use different
                           opcodes, but can expect continued rejections of CCBs using the
                           same opcode in the near future.

       Requests status information on a previously submitted CCB. The previously submitted CCB is identified
       by the 64-byte aligned real address of the CCBs completion area.

       A CCB can be in one of 4 states:


        State                     Value       Description
        COMPLETED                 0           The CCB has been fetched and executed, and is no longer active in
                                              the virtual machine.
        ENQUEUED                  1           The requested CCB is current in a queue awaiting execution.
        INPROGRESS                2           The CCB has been fetched and is currently being executed. It may still
                                              be possible to stop the execution using the ccb_kill hypercall.
        NOTFOUND                  3           The CCB could not be located in the virtual machine, and does not
                                              appear to have been executed. This may occur if the CCB was lost
                                              due to a hardware error, or the CCB may not have been successfully
                                              submitted to the virtual machine in the first place.

               Implementation note
               Some platforms may not be able to report CCBs that are currently being processed, and therefore
               guest software should invoke the ccb_kill hypercall prior to assuming the request CCB will never
               be executed because it was in the NOTFOUND state.

         The position return value is only valid when the state is ENQUEUED. The value returned is the number
         of other CCBs ahead of the requested CCB, to provide a relative estimate of when the CCB may execute.

         The dax return value is only valid when the state is ENQUEUED. The value returned is the DAX unit
         instance indentifier for the DAX unit processing the queue where the requested CCB is located. The value
         matches the value that would have been, or was, returned by ccb_submit using the queue info flag.

         The queue return value is only valid when the state is ENQUEUED. The value returned is the DAX

         Request to stop execution of a previously submitted CCB. The previously submitted CCB is identified by
         the 64-byte aligned real address of the CCBs completion area.

         The kill attempt can produce one of several values in the result return value, reflecting the CCB state
         and actions taken by the Hypervisor:

          Result                Value       Description
          COMPLETED             0           The CCB has been fetched and executed, and is no longer active in
                                            the virtual machine. It could not be killed and no action was taken.
          DEQUEUED              1           The requested CCB was still enqueued when the kill request was
                                            submitted, and has been removed from the queue. Since the CCB
                                            never began execution, no memory modifications were produced by
                                            it, and the completion area will never be updated. The same CCB may
                                            be submitted again, if desired, with no modifications required.
          KILLED                2           The CCB had been fetched and was being executed when the kill
                                            request was submitted. The CCB execution was stopped, and the CCB
                                            is no longer active in the virtual machine. The CCB completion area
                                            will reflect the killed status, with the subsequent implications that
                                            partial results may have been produced. Partial results may include full

          NOTFOUND               3           The CCB could not be located in the virtual machine, and does not
                                             appear to have been executed. This may occur if the CCB was lost
                                             due to a hardware error, or the CCB may not have been successfully
                                             submitted to the virtual machine in the first place. CCBs in the state
                                             are guaranteed to never execute in the future unless resubmitted.

36.3.3.1. Interactions with Pipelined CCBs

         If the pipeline target CCB is killed but the pipeline source CCB was skipped, the completion area of the
         target CCB may contain status (4,0) &quot;Command was skipped&quot; instead of (3,7) &quot;Command was killed&quot;.

         If the pipeline source CCB is killed, the pipeline target CCB's completion status may read (1,0) &quot;Success&quot;.
         This does not mean the target CCB was processed; since the source CCB was killed, there was no
         meaningful output on which the target CCB could operate.
