<p>L1 Terminal Fault is a hardware vulnerability which allows unprivileged
speculative access to data which is available in the Level 1 Data Cache
when the page table entry controlling the virtual address, which is used
for the access, has the Present bit cleared or other reserved bits set.</p>
<section id="affected-processors">
<h2>Affected processors<a class="headerlink" href="#affected-processors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This vulnerability affects a wide range of Intel processors. The
vulnerability is not present on:</p>

<h2>Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If an instruction accesses a virtual address for which the relevant page
table entry (PTE) has the Present bit cleared or other reserved bits set,
then speculative execution ignores the invalid PTE and loads the referenced
data if it is present in the Level 1 Data Cache, as if the page referenced
by the address bits in the PTE was still present and accessible.</p>
<p>While this is a purely speculative mechanism and the instruction will raise
a page fault when it is retired eventually, the pure act of loading the
data and making it available to other speculative instructions opens up the
opportunity for side channel attacks to unprivileged malicious code,
similar to the Meltdown attack.</p>
<p>While Meltdown breaks the user space to kernel space protection, L1TF
allows to attack any physical memory address in the system and the attack
works across all protection domains. It allows an attack of SGX and also
works from inside virtual machines because the speculation bypasses the
extended page table (EPT) protection mechanism.</p>

<h3>1. Malicious user space<a class="headerlink" href="#malicious-user-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Operating Systems store arbitrary information in the address bits of a
PTE which is marked non present. This allows a malicious user space
application to attack the physical memory to which these PTEs resolve.
In some cases user-space can maliciously influence the information
encoded in the address bits of the PTE, thus making attacks more
deterministic and more practical.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel contains a mitigation for this attack vector, PTE
inversion, which is permanently enabled and has no performance
impact. The kernel ensures that the address bits of PTEs, which are not
marked present, never point to cacheable physical memory space.</p>
<p>A system with an up to date kernel is protected against attacks from
malicious user space applications.</p>

<h3>2. Malicious guest in a virtual machine<a class="headerlink" href="#malicious-guest-in-a-virtual-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The fact that L1TF breaks all domain protections allows malicious guest
OSes, which can control the PTEs directly, and malicious guest user
space applications, which run on an unprotected guest kernel lacking the
PTE inversion mitigation for L1TF, to attack physical host memory.</p>
<p>A special aspect of L1TF in the context of virtualization is symmetric
multi threading (SMT). The Intel implementation of SMT is called
HyperThreading. The fact that Hyperthreads on the affected processors
share the L1 Data Cache (L1D) is important for this. As the flaw allows
only to attack data which is present in L1D, a malicious guest running
on one Hyperthread can attack the data which is brought into the L1D by
the context which runs on the sibling Hyperthread of the same physical
core. This context can be host OS, host user space or a different guest.</p>
<p>If the processor does not support Extended Page Tables, the attack is
only possible, when the hypervisor does not sanitize the content of the
effective (shadow) page tables.</p>
<p>While solutions exist to mitigate these attack vectors fully, these
mitigations are not enabled by default in the Linux kernel because they
can affect performance significantly. The kernel provides several
mechanisms which can be utilized to address the problem depending on the
deployment scenario. The mitigations, their protection scope and impact
are described in the next sections.</p>
<p>The default mitigations and the rationale for choosing them are explained
at the end of this document. See <a class="reference internal" href="#default-mitigations"><span class="std std-ref">Default mitigations</span></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>To make sure that a guest cannot attack data which is present in the L1D
the hypervisor flushes the L1D before entering the guest.</p>
<p>Flushing the L1D evicts not only the data which should not be accessed
by a potentially malicious guest, it also flushes the guest
data. Flushing the L1D has a performance impact as the processor has to
bring the flushed guest data back into the L1D. Depending on the
frequency of VMEXIT/VMENTER and the type of computations in the guest
performance degradation in the range of 1% to 50% has been observed. For
scenarios where guest VMEXIT/VMENTER are rare the performance impact is
minimal. Virtio and mechanisms like posted interrupts are designed to
confine the VMEXITs to a bare minimum, but specific configurations and
application scenarios might still suffer from a high VMEXIT rate.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The kernel provides two L1D flush modes:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>conditional (‘cond’)</p></li>
<li><p>unconditional (‘always’)</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The conditional mode avoids L1D flushing after VMEXITs which execute
only audited code paths before the corresponding VMENTER. These code
paths have been verified that they cannot expose secrets or other
interesting data to an attacker, but they can leak information about the
address space layout of the hypervisor.</p>
<p>Unconditional mode flushes L1D on all VMENTER invocations and provides
maximum protection. It has a higher overhead than the conditional
mode. The overhead cannot be quantified correctly as it depends on the
workload scenario and the resulting number of VMEXITs.</p>
<p>The general recommendation is to enable L1D flush on VMENTER. The kernel
defaults to conditional mode on affected processors.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, that L1D flush does not prevent the SMT problem because the
sibling thread will also bring back its data into the L1D which makes it
attackable again.</p>
<p>L1D flush can be controlled by the administrator via the kernel command
line and sysfs control files. See <a class="reference internal" href="#mitigation-control-command-line"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation control on the kernel command line</span></a>

<span id="guest-confinement"></span><h3>2. Guest VCPU confinement to dedicated physical cores<a class="headerlink" href="#guest-vcpu-confinement-to-dedicated-physical-cores" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>To address the SMT problem, it is possible to make a guest or a group of
guests affine to one or more physical cores. The proper mechanism for
that is to utilize exclusive cpusets to ensure that no other guest or
host tasks can run on these cores.</p>
<p>If only a single guest or related guests run on sibling SMT threads on
the same physical core then they can only attack their own memory and
restricted parts of the host memory.</p>
<p>Host memory is attackable, when one of the sibling SMT threads runs in
host OS (hypervisor) context and the other in guest context. The amount
of valuable information from the host OS context depends on the context
which the host OS executes, i.e. interrupts, soft interrupts and kernel
threads. The amount of valuable data from these contexts cannot be
declared as non-interesting for an attacker without deep inspection of
the code.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, that assigning guests to a fixed set of physical cores affects
the ability of the scheduler to do load balancing and might have
negative effects on CPU utilization depending on the hosting
scenario. Disabling SMT might be a viable alternative for particular
scenarios.</p>
<p>For further information about confining guests to a single or to a group
of cores consult the cpusets documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Interrupts can be made affine to logical CPUs. This is not universally
true because there are types of interrupts which are truly per CPU
interrupts, e.g. the local timer interrupt. Aside of that multi queue
devices affine their interrupts to single CPUs or groups of CPUs per
queue without allowing the administrator to control the affinities.</p>
<p>Moving the interrupts, which can be affinity controlled, away from CPUs
which run untrusted guests, reduces the attack vector space.</p>
<p>Whether the interrupts with are affine to CPUs, which run untrusted
guests, provide interesting data for an attacker depends on the system
configuration and the scenarios which run on the system. While for some
of the interrupts it can be assumed that they won’t expose interesting
information beyond exposing hints about the host OS memory layout, there
is no way to make general assumptions.</p>
<p>Interrupt affinity can be controlled by the administrator via the
/proc/irq/$NR/smp_affinity[_list] files. Limited documentation is

<blockquote>
<div><p>To prevent the SMT issues of L1TF it might be necessary to disable SMT
completely. Disabling SMT can have a significant performance impact, but
the impact depends on the hosting scenario and the type of workloads.
The impact of disabling SMT needs also to be weighted against the impact
of other mitigation solutions like confining guests to dedicated cores.</p>
<p>The kernel provides a sysfs interface to retrieve the status of SMT and
to control it. It also provides a kernel command line interface to
control SMT.</p>
<p>The kernel command line interface consists of the following options:</p>

kernel tries to bring all present CPUs online during the

to Machine Check Exceptions the non primary siblings have

<h4>3.3. SMT and EPT supported and active<a class="headerlink" href="#smt-and-ept-supported-and-active" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If SMT and EPT are supported and active then various degrees of
mitigations can be employed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>L1D flushing on VMENTER:</p>
<p>L1D flushing on VMENTER is the minimal protection requirement, but it
is only potent in combination with other mitigation methods.</p>
<p>Conditional L1D flushing is the default behaviour and can be tuned. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#mitigation-control-command-line"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation control on the kernel command line</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#mitigation-control-kvm"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation control for KVM - module parameter</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guest confinement:</p>
<p>Confinement of guests to a single or a group of physical cores which
are not running any other processes, can reduce the attack surface
significantly, but interrupts, soft interrupts and kernel threads can
still expose valuable data to a potential attacker. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#guest-confinement"><span class="std std-ref">2. Guest VCPU confinement to dedicated physical cores</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interrupt isolation:</p>
<p>Isolating the guest CPUs from interrupts can reduce the attack surface
further, but still allows a malicious guest to explore a limited amount
of host physical memory. This can at least be used to gain knowledge
about the host address space layout. The interrupts which have a fixed
affinity to the CPUs which run the untrusted guests can depending on
the scenario still trigger soft interrupts and schedule kernel threads
which might expose valuable information. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#interrupt-isolation"><span class="std std-ref">3. Interrupt affinity</span></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The above three mitigation methods combined can provide protection to a
certain degree, but the risk of the remaining attack surface has to be
carefully analyzed. For full protection the following methods are
available:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Disabling SMT:</p>
<p>Disabling SMT and enforcing the L1D flushing provides the maximum
amount of protection. This mitigation is not depending on any of the
above mitigation methods.</p>
<p>SMT control and L1D flushing can be tuned by the command line
parameters ‘nosmt’, ‘l1tf’, ‘kvm-intel.vmentry_l1d_flush’ and at run
time with the matching sysfs control files. See <a class="reference internal" href="#smt-control"><span class="std std-ref">4. SMT control</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#mitigation-control-command-line"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation control on the kernel command line</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#mitigation-control-kvm"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation control for KVM - module parameter</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disabling EPT:</p>
<p>Disabling EPT provides the maximum amount of protection as well. It is
not depending on any of the above mitigation methods. SMT can stay
enabled and L1D flushing is not required, but the performance impact is
significant.</p>
<p>EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the ‘kvm-intel.ept’
parameter.</p>

<h4>3.4. Nested virtual machines<a class="headerlink" href="#nested-virtual-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When nested virtualization is in use, three operating systems are involved:
the bare metal hypervisor, the nested hypervisor and the nested virtual
machine.  VMENTER operations from the nested hypervisor into the nested
guest will always be processed by the bare metal hypervisor. If KVM is the
bare metal hypervisor it will:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Flush the L1D cache on every switch from the nested hypervisor to the
nested virtual machine, so that the nested hypervisor’s secrets are not
exposed to the nested virtual machine;</p></li>
<li><p>Flush the L1D cache on every switch from the nested virtual machine to
the nested hypervisor; this is a complex operation, and flushing the L1D
cache avoids that the bare metal hypervisor’s secrets are exposed to the
nested virtual machine;</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct the nested hypervisor to not perform any L1D cache flush. This
is an optimization to avoid double L1D flushing.</p></li>

<section id="default-mitigations">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Default mitigations<a class="headerlink" href="#default-mitigations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The kernel default mitigations for vulnerable processors are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PTE inversion to protect against malicious user space. This is done
unconditionally and cannot be controlled. The swap storage is limited
to ~16TB.</p></li>
<li><p>L1D conditional flushing on VMENTER when EPT is enabled for
a guest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel does not by default enforce the disabling of SMT, which leaves
SMT systems vulnerable when running untrusted guests with EPT enabled.</p>
<p>The rationale for this choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Force disabling SMT can break existing setups, especially with
unattended updates.</p></li>
<li><p>If regular users run untrusted guests on their machine, then L1TF is
just an add on to other malware which might be embedded in an untrusted
guest, e.g. spam-bots or attacks on the local network.</p>
<p>There is no technical way to prevent a user from running untrusted code
on their machines blindly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s technically extremely unlikely and from today’s knowledge even
impossible that L1TF can be exploited via the most popular attack
mechanisms like JavaScript because these mechanisms have no way to
control PTEs. If this would be possible and not other mitigation would
be possible, then the default might be different.</p></li>
<li><p>The administrators of cloud and hosting setups have to carefully
analyze the risk for their scenarios and make the appropriate
mitigation choices, which might even vary across their deployed
machines and also result in other changes of their overall setup.
There is no way for the kernel to provide a sensible default for this
kind of scenarios.</p></li>
