<h1>A block layer cache (bcache)<a class="headerlink" href="#a-block-layer-cache-bcache" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Say you’ve got a big slow raid 6, and an ssd or three. Wouldn’t it be
nice if you could use them as cache… Hence bcache.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The bcache wiki can be found at:</dt><dd><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bcache.evilpiepirate.org">https://bcache.evilpiepirate.org</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>This is the git repository of bcache-tools:</dt><dd><p><a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/colyli/bcache-tools.git/">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/colyli/bcache-tools.git/</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>The latest bcache kernel code can be found from mainline Linux kernel:</dt><dd><p><a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It’s designed around the performance characteristics of SSDs - it only allocates
in erase block sized buckets, and it uses a hybrid btree/log to track cached
extents (which can be anywhere from a single sector to the bucket size). It’s
designed to avoid random writes at all costs; it fills up an erase block
sequentially, then issues a discard before reusing it.</p>
<p>Both writethrough and writeback caching are supported. Writeback defaults to
off, but can be switched on and off arbitrarily at runtime. Bcache goes to
great lengths to protect your data - it reliably handles unclean shutdown. (It
doesn’t even have a notion of a clean shutdown; bcache simply doesn’t return
writes as completed until they’re on stable storage).</p>
<p>Writeback caching can use most of the cache for buffering writes - writing
dirty data to the backing device is always done sequentially, scanning from the
start to the end of the index.</p>
<p>Since random IO is what SSDs excel at, there generally won’t be much benefit
to caching large sequential IO. Bcache detects sequential IO and skips it;
it also keeps a rolling average of the IO sizes per task, and as long as the
average is above the cutoff it will skip all IO from that task - instead of
caching the first 512k after every seek. Backups and large file copies should
thus entirely bypass the cache.</p>
<p>In the event of a data IO error on the flash it will try to recover by reading
from disk or invalidating cache entries.  For unrecoverable errors (meta data
or dirty data), caching is automatically disabled; if dirty data was present
in the cache it first disables writeback caching and waits for all dirty data
to be flushed.</p>
<p>Getting started:
You’ll need bcache util from the bcache-tools repository. Both the cache device
and backing device must be formatted before use:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bcache make -B /dev/sdb
bcache make -C /dev/sdc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><cite>bcache make</cite> has the ability to format multiple devices at the same time - if
you format your backing devices and cache device at the same time, you won’t
have to manually attach:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bcache make -B /dev/sda /dev/sdb -C /dev/sdc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If your bcache-tools is not updated to latest version and does not have the
unified <cite>bcache</cite> utility, you may use the legacy <cite>make-bcache</cite> utility to format
bcache device with same -B and -C parameters.</p>
<p>bcache-tools now ships udev rules, and bcache devices are known to the kernel
immediately.  Without udev, you can manually register devices like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo /dev/sdb &gt; /sys/fs/bcache/register
echo /dev/sdc &gt; /sys/fs/bcache/register
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Registering the backing device makes the bcache device show up in /dev; you can
now format it and use it as normal. But the first time using a new bcache
device, it’ll be running in passthrough mode until you attach it to a cache.
If you are thinking about using bcache later, it is recommended to setup all your
slow devices as bcache backing devices without a cache, and you can choose to add
a caching device later.
See ‘ATTACHING’ section below.</p>
<p>The devices show up as:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/dev/bcache&lt;N&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As well as (with udev):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/dev/bcache/by-uuid/&lt;uuid&gt;
/dev/bcache/by-label/&lt;label&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To get started:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkfs.ext4 /dev/bcache0
mount /dev/bcache0 /mnt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can control bcache devices through sysfs at /sys/block/bcache&lt;N&gt;/bcache .
You can also control them through /sys/fs//bcache/&lt;cset-uuid&gt;/ .</p>
<p>Cache devices are managed as sets; multiple caches per set isn’t supported yet
but will allow for mirroring of metadata and dirty data in the future. Your new
cache set shows up as /sys/fs/bcache/&lt;UUID&gt;</p>
<section id="attaching">
<h2>Attaching<a class="headerlink" href="#attaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After your cache device and backing device are registered, the backing device
must be attached to your cache set to enable caching. Attaching a backing
device to a cache set is done thusly, with the UUID of the cache set in
/sys/fs/bcache:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &lt;CSET-UUID&gt; &gt; /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This only has to be done once. The next time you reboot, just reregister all
your bcache devices. If a backing device has data in a cache somewhere, the
/dev/bcache&lt;N&gt; device won’t be created until the cache shows up - particularly
important if you have writeback caching turned on.</p>
<p>If you’re booting up and your cache device is gone and never coming back, you
can force run the backing device:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sdb/bcache/running
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(You need to use /sys/block/sdb (or whatever your backing device is called), not
/sys/block/bcache0, because bcache0 doesn’t exist yet. If you’re using a
partition, the bcache directory would be at /sys/block/sdb/sdb2/bcache)</p>
<p>The backing device will still use that cache set if it shows up in the future,
but all the cached data will be invalidated. If there was dirty data in the
cache, don’t expect the filesystem to be recoverable - you will have massive
filesystem corruption, though ext4’s fsck does work miracles.</p>
</section>
<section id="error-handling">
<h2>Error Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#error-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bcache tries to transparently handle IO errors to/from the cache device without
affecting normal operation; if it sees too many errors (the threshold is
configurable, and defaults to 0) it shuts down the cache device and switches all
the backing devices to passthrough mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>For reads from the cache, if they error we just retry the read from the
backing device.</p></li>
<li><p>For writethrough writes, if the write to the cache errors we just switch to
invalidating the data at that lba in the cache (i.e. the same thing we do for
a write that bypasses the cache)</p></li>
<li><p>For writeback writes, we currently pass that error back up to the
filesystem/userspace. This could be improved - we could retry it as a write
that skips the cache so we don’t have to error the write.</p></li>
<li><p>When we detach, we first try to flush any dirty data (if we were running in
writeback mode). It currently doesn’t do anything intelligent if it fails to
read some of the dirty data, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting performance<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bcache has a bunch of config options and tunables. The defaults are intended to
be reasonable for typical desktop and server workloads, but they’re not what you
want for getting the best possible numbers when benchmarking.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Backing device alignment</p>
<p>The default metadata size in bcache is 8k.  If your backing device is
RAID based, then be sure to align this by a multiple of your stride
width using <cite>bcache make –data-offset</cite>. If you intend to expand your
disk array in the future, then multiply a series of primes by your
raid stripe size to get the disk multiples that you would like.</p>
<p>For example:  If you have a 64k stripe size, then the following offset
would provide alignment for many common RAID5 data spindle counts:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>64k * 2*2*2*3*3*5*7 bytes = 161280k
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That space is wasted, but for only 157.5MB you can grow your RAID 5
volume to the following data-spindle counts without re-aligning:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,15,18,20,21 ...
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Bad write performance</p>
<p>If write performance is not what you expected, you probably wanted to be
running in writeback mode, which isn’t the default (not due to a lack of
maturity, but simply because in writeback mode you’ll lose data if something
happens to your SSD):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># echo writeback &gt; /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/cache_mode
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Bad performance, or traffic not going to the SSD that you’d expect</p>
<p>By default, bcache doesn’t cache everything. It tries to skip sequential IO -
because you really want to be caching the random IO, and if you copy a 10
gigabyte file you probably don’t want that pushing 10 gigabytes of randomly
accessed data out of your cache.</p>
<p>But if you want to benchmark reads from cache, and you start out with fio
writing an 8 gigabyte test file - so you want to disable that:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># echo 0 &gt; /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/sequential_cutoff
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To set it back to the default (4 mb), do:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># echo 4M &gt; /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/sequential_cutoff
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Traffic’s still going to the spindle/still getting cache misses</p>
<p>In the real world, SSDs don’t always keep up with disks - particularly with
slower SSDs, many disks being cached by one SSD, or mostly sequential IO. So
you want to avoid being bottlenecked by the SSD and having it slow everything
down.</p>
<p>To avoid that bcache tracks latency to the cache device, and gradually
throttles traffic if the latency exceeds a threshold (it does this by
cranking down the sequential bypass).</p>
<p>You can disable this if you need to by setting the thresholds to 0:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># echo 0 &gt; /sys/fs/bcache/&lt;cache set&gt;/congested_read_threshold_us
# echo 0 &gt; /sys/fs/bcache/&lt;cache set&gt;/congested_write_threshold_us
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The default is 2000 us (2 milliseconds) for reads, and 20000 for writes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Still getting cache misses, of the same data</p>
<p>One last issue that sometimes trips people up is actually an old bug, due to
the way cache coherency is handled for cache misses. If a btree node is full,
a cache miss won’t be able to insert a key for the new data and the data
won’t be written to the cache.</p>
<p>In practice this isn’t an issue because as soon as a write comes along it’ll
cause the btree node to be split, and you need almost no write traffic for
this to not show up enough to be noticeable (especially since bcache’s btree
nodes are huge and index large regions of the device). But when you’re
benchmarking, if you’re trying to warm the cache by reading a bunch of data
and there’s no other traffic - that can be a problem.</p>
<p>Solution: warm the cache by doing writes, or use the testing branch (there’s
a fix for the issue there).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>attach</dt><dd><p>Echo the UUID of a cache set to this file to enable caching.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cache_mode</dt><dd><p>Can be one of either writethrough, writeback, writearound or none.</p>
</dd>
<dt>clear_stats</dt><dd><p>Writing to this file resets the running total stats (not the day/hour/5 minute
decaying versions).</p>
</dd>
<dt>detach</dt><dd><p>Write to this file to detach from a cache set. If there is dirty data in the
cache, it will be flushed first.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dirty_data</dt><dd><p>Amount of dirty data for this backing device in the cache. Continuously
updated unlike the cache set’s version, but may be slightly off.</p>
</dd>
<dt>label</dt><dd><p>Name of underlying device.</p>
</dd>
<dt>readahead</dt><dd><p>Size of readahead that should be performed.  Defaults to 0.  If set to e.g.
1M, it will round cache miss reads up to that size, but without overlapping
existing cache entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt>running</dt><dd><p>1 if bcache is running (i.e. whether the /dev/bcache device exists, whether
it’s in passthrough mode or caching).</p>
</dd>
<dt>sequential_cutoff</dt><dd><p>A sequential IO will bypass the cache once it passes this threshold; the
most recent 128 IOs are tracked so sequential IO can be detected even when
it isn’t all done at once.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sequential_merge</dt><dd><p>If non zero, bcache keeps a list of the last 128 requests submitted to compare
against all new requests to determine which new requests are sequential
continuations of previous requests for the purpose of determining sequential
cutoff. This is necessary if the sequential cutoff value is greater than the
maximum acceptable sequential size for any single request.</p>
</dd>
<dt>state</dt><dd><p>The backing device can be in one of four different states:</p>
<p>no cache: Has never been attached to a cache set.</p>
<p>clean: Part of a cache set, and there is no cached dirty data.</p>
<p>dirty: Part of a cache set, and there is cached dirty data.</p>
<p>inconsistent: The backing device was forcibly run by the user when there was
dirty data cached but the cache set was unavailable; whatever data was on the
backing device has likely been corrupted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stop</dt><dd><p>Write to this file to shut down the bcache device and close the backing
device.</p>
</dd>
<dt>writeback_delay</dt><dd><p>When dirty data is written to the cache and it previously did not contain
any, waits some number of seconds before initiating writeback. Defaults to
30.</p>
</dd>
<dt>writeback_percent</dt><dd><p>If nonzero, bcache tries to keep around this percentage of the cache dirty by
throttling background writeback and using a PD controller to smoothly adjust
the rate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>writeback_rate</dt><dd><p>Rate in sectors per second - if writeback_percent is nonzero, background
writeback is throttled to this rate. Continuously adjusted by bcache but may
also be set by the user.</p>
</dd>
<dt>writeback_running</dt><dd><p>If off, writeback of dirty data will not take place at all. Dirty data will
still be added to the cache until it is mostly full; only meant for
benchmarking. Defaults to on.</p>

<h3>Sysfs - backing device stats<a class="headerlink" href="#sysfs-backing-device-stats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are directories with these numbers for a running total, as well as
versions that decay over the past day, hour and 5 minutes; they’re also
aggregated in the cache set directory as well.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>bypassed</dt><dd><p>Amount of IO (both reads and writes) that has bypassed the cache</p>

<dt>cache_hits, cache_misses, cache_hit_ratio</dt><dd><p>Hits and misses are counted per individual IO as bcache sees them; a
partial hit is counted as a miss.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cache_bypass_hits, cache_bypass_misses</dt><dd><p>Hits and misses for IO that is intended to skip the cache are still counted,
but broken out here.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cache_miss_collisions</dt><dd><p>Counts instances where data was going to be inserted into the cache from a
cache miss, but raced with a write and data was already present (usually 0
since the synchronization for cache misses was rewritten)</p>

slow).</p>

<dt>freelist_percent</dt><dd><p>Size of the freelist as a percentage of nbuckets. Can be written to to
increase the number of buckets kept on the freelist, which lets you
artificially reduce the size of the cache at runtime. Mostly for testing
purposes (i.e. testing how different size caches affect your hit rate), but
since buckets are discarded when they move on to the freelist will also make
the SSD’s garbage collection easier by effectively giving it more reserved

This can reveal your working set size.  Unused is the percentage of
the cache that doesn’t contain any data.  Metadata is bcache’s
metadata overhead.  Average is the average priority of cache buckets.
Next is a list of quantiles with the priority threshold of each.</p>
