<h1>Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This module supports the SMB3 family of advanced network protocols (as well
as older dialects, originally called “CIFS” or SMB1).</p>
<p>The CIFS VFS module for Linux supports many advanced network filesystem
features such as hierarchical DFS like namespace, hardlinks, locking and more.
It was designed to comply with the SNIA CIFS Technical Reference (which
supersedes the 1992 X/Open SMB Standard) as well as to perform best practice
practical interoperability with Windows 2000, Windows XP, Samba and equivalent
servers.  This code was developed in participation with the Protocol Freedom
Information Foundation.  CIFS and now SMB3 has now become a defacto
standard for interoperating between Macs and Windows and major NAS appliances.</p>

<section id="installation-instructions">
<h2>Installation instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have built the CIFS vfs as module (successfully) simply
type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">modules_install</span></code> (or if you prefer, manually copy the file to
the modules directory e.g. /lib/modules/2.4.10-4GB/kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko).</p>
<p>If you have built the CIFS vfs into the kernel itself, follow the instructions
for your distribution on how to install a new kernel (usually you
would simply type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code>).</p>
<p>If you do not have the utility mount.cifs (in the Samba 4.x source tree and on
the CIFS VFS web site) copy it to the same directory in which mount helpers
reside (usually /sbin).  Although the helper software is not
required, mount.cifs is recommended.  Most distros include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cifs-utils</span></code>
package that includes this utility so it is recommended to install this.</p>
<p>Note that running the Winbind pam/nss module (logon service) on all of your
Linux clients is useful in mapping Uids and Gids consistently across the
domain to the proper network user.  The mount.cifs mount helper can be
found at cifs-utils.git on git.samba.org</p>
<p>If cifs is built as a module, then the size and number of network buffers
and maximum number of simultaneous requests to one server can be configured.
Changing these from their defaults is not recommended. By executing modinfo:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>modinfo kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko the list of configuration changes that can be made
at module initialization time (by running insmod cifs.ko) can be seen.</p>

<section id="recommendations">
<h2>Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To improve security the SMB2.1 dialect or later (usually will get SMB3) is now
the new default. To use old dialects (e.g. to mount Windows XP) use “vers=1.0”
on mount (or vers=2.0 for Windows Vista).  Note that the CIFS (vers=1.0) is
much older and less secure than the default dialect SMB3 which includes
many advanced security features such as downgrade attack detection
and encrypted shares and stronger signing and authentication algorithms.
There are additional mount options that may be helpful for SMB3 to get
improved POSIX behavior (NB: can use vers=3.0 to force only SMB3, never 2.1):</p>

<section id="allowing-user-mounts">
<h2>Allowing User Mounts<a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-user-mounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To permit users to mount and unmount over directories they own is possible
with the cifs vfs.  A way to enable such mounting is to mark the mount.cifs
utility as suid (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">+s</span> <span class="pre">/sbin/mount.cifs</span></code>). To enable users to
umount shares they mount requires</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>mount.cifs version 1.4 or later</p></li>
<li><p>an entry for the share in /etc/fstab indicating that a user may
unmount it e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>//server/usersharename  /mnt/username cifs user 0 0
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that when the mount.cifs utility is run suid (allowing user mounts),
in order to reduce risks, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code> mount flag is passed in on mount to
disallow execution of an suid program mounted on the remote target.
When mount is executed as root, nosuid is not passed in by default,
and execution of suid programs on the remote target would be enabled
by default. This can be changed, as with nfs and other filesystems,
by simply specifying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code> among the mount options. For user mounts
though to be able to pass the suid flag to mount requires rebuilding
mount.cifs with the following flag: CIFS_ALLOW_USR_SUID</p>
<p>There is a corresponding manual page for cifs mounting in the Samba 3.0 and
later source tree in docs/manpages/mount.cifs.8</p>
</section>
<section id="allowing-user-unmounts">
<h2>Allowing User Unmounts<a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-user-unmounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To permit users to unmount directories that they have user mounted (see above),
the utility umount.cifs may be used.  It may be invoked directly, or if
umount.cifs is placed in /sbin, umount can invoke the cifs umount helper
(at least for most versions of the umount utility) for umount of cifs
mounts, unless umount is invoked with -i (which will avoid invoking a umount
helper). As with mount.cifs, to enable user unmounts umount.cifs must be marked
as suid (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">+s</span> <span class="pre">/sbin/umount.cifs</span></code>) or equivalent (some distributions
allow adding entries to a file to the /etc/permissions file to achieve the
equivalent suid effect).  For this utility to succeed the target path
must be a cifs mount, and the uid of the current user must match the uid
of the user who mounted the resource.</p>
<p>Also note that the customary way of allowing user mounts and unmounts is
(instead of using mount.cifs and unmount.cifs as suid) to add a line
to the file /etc/fstab for each //server/share you wish to mount, but
this can become unwieldy when potential mount targets include many
or  unpredictable UNC names.</p>

<section id="samba-considerations">
<h2>Samba Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#samba-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most current servers support SMB2.1 and SMB3 which are more secure,
but there are useful protocol extensions for the older less secure CIFS
dialect, so to get the maximum benefit if mounting using the older dialect
(CIFS/SMB1), we recommend using a server that supports the SNIA CIFS
Unix Extensions standard (e.g. almost any  version of Samba ie version
2.2.5 or later) but the CIFS vfs works fine with a wide variety of CIFS servers.
Note that uid, gid and file permissions will display default values if you do
not have a server that supports the Unix extensions for CIFS (such as Samba
2.2.5 or later).  To enable the Unix CIFS Extensions in the Samba server, add
the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unix extensions = yes
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to your smb.conf file on the server.  Note that the following smb.conf settings
are also useful (on the Samba server) when the majority of clients are Unix or
Linux:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>case sensitive = yes
delete readonly = yes
ea support = yes
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that server ea support is required for supporting xattrs from the Linux
cifs client, and that EA support is present in later versions of Samba (e.g.
3.0.6 and later (also EA support works in all versions of Windows, at least to
shares on NTFS filesystems).  Extended Attribute (xattr) support is an optional
feature of most Linux filesystems which may require enabling via
make menuconfig. Client support for extended attributes (user xattr) can be
disabled on a per-mount basis by specifying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nouser_xattr</span></code> on mount.</p>
<p>The CIFS client can get and set POSIX ACLs (getfacl, setfacl) to Samba servers
version 3.10 and later.  Setting POSIX ACLs requires enabling both XATTR and
then POSIX support in the CIFS configuration options when building the cifs
module.  POSIX ACL support can be disabled on a per mount basic by specifying
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noacl</span></code> on mount.</p>
<p>Some administrators may want to change Samba’s smb.conf <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">map</span> <span class="pre">archive</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">create</span> <span class="pre">mask</span></code> parameters from the default.  Unless the create mask is changed
newly created files can end up with an unnecessarily restrictive default mode,
which may not be what you want, although if the CIFS Unix extensions are
enabled on the server and client, subsequent setattr calls (e.g. chmod) can
fix the mode.  Note that creating special devices (mknod) remotely
may require specifying a mkdev function to Samba if you are not using
Samba 3.0.6 or later.  For more information on these see the manual pages
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">smb.conf</span></code>) on the Samba server system.  Note that the cifs vfs,
unlike the smbfs vfs, does not read the smb.conf on the client system
(the few optional settings are passed in on mount via -o parameters instead).
Note that Samba 2.2.7 or later includes a fix that allows the CIFS VFS to delete
open files (required for strict POSIX compliance).  Windows Servers already
supported this feature. Samba server does not allow symlinks that refer to files
outside of the share, so in Samba versions prior to 3.0.6, most symlinks to
files with absolute paths (ie beginning with slash) such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ln -s /mnt/foo bar
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>would be forbidden. Samba 3.0.6 server or later includes the ability to create
such symlinks safely by converting unsafe symlinks (ie symlinks to server
files that are outside of the share) to a samba specific format on the server
that is ignored by local server applications and non-cifs clients and that will
not be traversed by the Samba server).  This is opaque to the Linux client
application using the cifs vfs. Absolute symlinks will work to Samba 3.0.5 or
later, but only for remote clients using the CIFS Unix extensions, and will
be invisible to Windows clients and typically will not affect local
applications running on the same server as Samba.</p>

<section id="use-instructions">
<h2>Use instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#use-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the CIFS VFS support is built into the kernel or installed as a module
(cifs.ko), you can use mount syntax like the following to access Samba or
Mac or Windows servers:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mount -t cifs //9.53.216.11/e$ /mnt -o username=myname,password=mypassword
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Before -o the option -v may be specified to make the mount.cifs
mount helper display the mount steps more verbosely.
After -o the following commonly used cifs vfs specific options
are supported:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>username=&lt;username&gt;
password=&lt;password&gt;
domain=&lt;domain name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Other cifs mount options are described below.  Use of TCP names (in addition to
ip addresses) is available if the mount helper (mount.cifs) is installed. If
you do not trust the server to which are mounted, or if you do not have
cifs signing enabled (and the physical network is insecure), consider use
of the standard mount options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noexec</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code> to reduce the risk of
running an altered binary on your local system (downloaded from a hostile server
or altered by a hostile router).</p>
<p>Although mounting using format corresponding to the CIFS URL specification is
not possible in mount.cifs yet, it is possible to use an alternate format
for the server and sharename (which is somewhat similar to NFS style mount
syntax) instead of the more widely used UNC format (i.e. \servershare):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mount -t cifs tcp_name_of_server:share_name /mnt -o user=myname,pass=mypasswd
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When using the mount helper mount.cifs, passwords may be specified via alternate
mechanisms, instead of specifying it after -o using the normal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pass=</span></code> syntax
on the command line:
1) By including it in a credential file. Specify credentials=filename as one
of the mount options. Credential files contain two lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>username=someuser
password=your_password
</pre></div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>By specifying the password in the PASSWD environment variable (similarly
the user name can be taken from the USER environment variable).</p></li>
<li><p>By specifying the password in a file by name via PASSWD_FILE</p></li>
<li><p>By specifying the password in a file by file descriptor via PASSWD_FD</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If no password is provided, mount.cifs will prompt for password entry</p>
</section>
<section id="restrictions">
<h2>Restrictions<a class="headerlink" href="#restrictions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Servers must support either “pure-TCP” (port 445 TCP/IP CIFS connections) or RFC
1001/1002 support for “Netbios-Over-TCP/IP.” This is not likely to be a
problem as most servers support this.</p>
<p>Valid filenames differ between Windows and Linux.  Windows typically restricts
filenames which contain certain reserved characters (e.g.the character :
which is used to delimit the beginning of a stream name by Windows), while
Linux allows a slightly wider set of valid characters in filenames. Windows
servers can remap such characters when an explicit mapping is specified in
the Server’s registry.  Samba starting with version 3.10 will allow such
filenames (ie those which contain valid Linux characters, which normally
would be forbidden for Windows/CIFS semantics) as long as the server is
configured for Unix Extensions (and the client has not disabled
/proc/fs/cifs/LinuxExtensionsEnabled). In addition the mount option
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapposix</span></code> can be used on CIFS (vers=1.0) to force the mapping of
illegal Windows/NTFS/SMB characters to a remap range (this mount parameter
is the default for SMB3). This remap (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapposix</span></code>) range is also
compatible with Mac (and “Services for Mac” on some older Windows).</p>

supports the CIFS Unix Extensions but the UIDs/GIDs on the
client and server system do not match closely enough to allow
access by the user doing the mount, but it may be useful with
non CIFS Unix Extension mounts for cases in which the default
mode is specified on the mount but is not to be enforced on the
client (e.g. perhaps when MultiUserMount is enabled)
Note that this does not affect the normal ACL check on the
target machine done by the server software (of the server
ACL against the user name provided at mount time).</p>

<dt>serverino</dt><dd><p>Use server’s inode numbers instead of generating automatically
incrementing inode numbers on the client.  Although this will
make it easier to spot hardlinked files (as they will have
the same inode numbers) and inode numbers may be persistent,
note that the server does not guarantee that the inode numbers
are unique if multiple server side mounts are exported under a
single share (since inode numbers on the servers might not
be unique if multiple filesystems are mounted under the same
shared higher level directory).  Note that some older
(e.g. pre-Windows 2000) do not support returning UniqueIDs
or the CIFS Unix Extensions equivalent and for those
this mount option will have no effect.  Exporting cifs mounts
under nfsd requires this mount option on the cifs mount.
This is now the default if server supports the
required network operation.</p>

instead of using the default uid and gid specified on
the mount, cache the new file’s uid and gid locally which means
that the uid for the file can change when the inode is
reloaded (or the user remounts the share).</p>
</dd>
<dt>nosetuids</dt><dd><p>The client will not attempt to set the uid and gid on

the client) set the uid and gid is the default. If the CIFS

this can provide better performance than the default

very slow, and some servers may be reliable enough (to risk
delaying slightly flushing the data to disk on the server),
turning on this option may be useful to improve performance for

is not oplocked, it could still be cacheable (ie cifs client
could grant fcntl leases if no other local processes are using
the file) for cases for example such as when the server does not
support oplocks and the user is sure that the only updates to
the file will be from this client. Specifying this mount option

<p>These experimental features and tracing can be enabled by changing flags in
/proc/fs/cifs (after the cifs module has been installed or built into the
kernel, e.g.  insmod cifs).  To enable a feature set it to 1 e.g.  to enable
tracing to the kernel message log type:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 7 &gt; /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>cifsFYI functions as a bit mask. Setting it to 1 enables additional kernel
logging of various informational messages.  2 enables logging of non-zero
SMB return codes while 4 enables logging of requests that take longer
than one second to complete (except for byte range lock requests).
Setting it to 4 requires CONFIG_CIFS_STATS2 to be set in kernel configuration
(.config). Setting it to seven enables all three.  Finally, tracing
the start of smb requests and responses can be enabled via:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 1 &gt; /proc/fs/cifs/traceSMB
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Per share (per client mount) statistics are available in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats.
Additional information is available if CONFIG_CIFS_STATS2 is enabled in the
kernel configuration (.config).  The statistics returned include counters which
represent the number of attempted and failed (ie non-zero return code from the
server) SMB3 (or cifs) requests grouped by request type (read, write, close etc.).
Also recorded is the total bytes read and bytes written to the server for
that share.  Note that due to client caching effects this can be less than the
number of bytes read and written by the application running on the client.
Statistics can be reset to zero by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">/proc/fs/cifs/Stats</span></code> which may be
useful if comparing performance of two different scenarios.</p>
<p>Also note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">/proc/fs/cifs/DebugData</span></code> will display information about
the active sessions and the shares that are mounted.</p>
<p>Enabling Kerberos (extended security) works but requires version 1.2 or later
of the helper program cifs.upcall to be present and to be configured in the
/etc/request-key.conf file.  The cifs.upcall helper program is from the Samba
project(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.samba.org">https://www.samba.org</a>). NTLM and NTLMv2 and LANMAN support do not
require this helper. Note that NTLMv2 security (which does not require the
cifs.upcall helper program), instead of using Kerberos, is sufficient for
some use cases.</p>
<p>DFS support allows transparent redirection to shares in an MS-DFS name space.
In addition, DFS support for target shares which are specified as UNC
names which begin with host names (rather than IP addresses) requires
a user space helper (such as cifs.upcall) to be present in order to
translate host names to ip address, and the user space helper must also
be configured in the file /etc/request-key.conf.  Samba, Windows servers and
many NAS appliances support DFS as a way of constructing a global name
space to ease network configuration and improve reliability.</p>
<p>To use cifs Kerberos and DFS support, the Linux keyutils package should be
installed and something like the following lines should be added to the
/etc/request-key.conf file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>create cifs.spnego * * /usr/local/sbin/cifs.upcall %k
