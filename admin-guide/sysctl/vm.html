<h2>admin_reserve_kbytes<a class="headerlink" href="#admin-reserve-kbytes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The amount of free memory in the system that should be reserved for users
with the capability cap_sys_admin.</p>
<p>admin_reserve_kbytes defaults to min(3% of free pages, 8MB)</p>
<p>That should provide enough for the admin to log in and kill a process,
if necessary, under the default overcommit ‘guess’ mode.</p>
<p>Systems running under overcommit ‘never’ should increase this to account
for the full Virtual Memory Size of programs used to recover. Otherwise,
root may not be able to log in to recover the system.</p>
<p>How do you calculate a minimum useful reserve?</p>
<p>sshd or login + bash (or some other shell) + top (or ps, kill, etc.)</p>
<p>For overcommit ‘guess’, we can sum resident set sizes (RSS).
On x86_64 this is about 8MB.</p>
<p>For overcommit ‘never’, we can take the max of their virtual sizes (VSZ)
and add the sum of their RSS.
On x86_64 this is about 128MB.</p>
<p>Changing this takes effect whenever an application requests memory.</p>

<section id="compact-memory">
<h2>compact_memory<a class="headerlink" href="#compact-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Available only when CONFIG_COMPACTION is set. When 1 is written to the file,
all zones are compacted such that free memory is available in contiguous
blocks where possible. This can be important for example in the allocation of
huge pages although processes will also directly compact memory as required.</p>
</section>
<section id="compaction-proactiveness">
<h2>compaction_proactiveness<a class="headerlink" href="#compaction-proactiveness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tunable takes a value in the range [0, 100] with a default value of
20. This tunable determines how aggressively compaction is done in the
background. Write of a non zero value to this tunable will immediately
trigger the proactive compaction. Setting it to 0 disables proactive compaction.</p>
<p>Note that compaction has a non-trivial system-wide impact as pages
belonging to different processes are moved around, which could also lead
to latency spikes in unsuspecting applications. The kernel employs
various heuristics to avoid wasting CPU cycles if it detects that
proactive compaction is not being effective.</p>
<p>Be careful when setting it to extreme values like 100, as that may
cause excessive background compaction activity.</p>
</section>
<section id="compact-unevictable-allowed">
<h2>compact_unevictable_allowed<a class="headerlink" href="#compact-unevictable-allowed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Available only when CONFIG_COMPACTION is set. When set to 1, compaction is
allowed to examine the unevictable lru (mlocked pages) for pages to compact.
This should be used on systems where stalls for minor page faults are an
acceptable trade for large contiguous free memory.  Set to 0 to prevent
compaction from moving pages that are unevictable.  Default value is 1.
On CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT the default value is 0 in order to avoid a page fault, due
to compaction, which would block the task from becoming active until the fault
is resolved.</p>

<section id="dirty-expire-centisecs">
<h2>dirty_expire_centisecs<a class="headerlink" href="#dirty-expire-centisecs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tunable is used to define when dirty data is old enough to be eligible
for writeout by the kernel flusher threads.  It is expressed in 100’ths
of a second.  Data which has been dirty in-memory for longer than this
interval will be written out next time a flusher thread wakes up.</p>

</section>
<section id="dirtytime-expire-seconds">
<h2>dirtytime_expire_seconds<a class="headerlink" href="#dirtytime-expire-seconds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a lazytime inode is constantly having its pages dirtied, the inode with
an updated timestamp will never get chance to be written out.  And, if the
only thing that has happened on the file system is a dirtytime inode caused
by an atime update, a worker will be scheduled to make sure that inode
eventually gets pushed out to disk.  This tunable is used to define when dirty
inode is old enough to be eligible for writeback by the kernel flusher threads.
And, it is also used as the interval to wakeup dirtytime_writeback thread.</p>
</section>
<section id="dirty-writeback-centisecs">
<h2>dirty_writeback_centisecs<a class="headerlink" href="#dirty-writeback-centisecs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The kernel flusher threads will periodically wake up and write <cite>old</cite> data
out to disk.  This tunable expresses the interval between those wakeups, in
100’ths of a second.</p>
<p>Setting this to zero disables periodic writeback altogether.</p>
</section>
<section id="drop-caches">
<h2>drop_caches<a class="headerlink" href="#drop-caches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, as well as
reclaimable slab objects like dentries and inodes.  Once dropped, their
memory becomes free.</p>
<p>To free pagecache:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To free reclaimable slab objects (includes dentries and inodes):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To free slab objects and pagecache:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a non-destructive operation and will not free any dirty objects.
To increase the number of objects freed by this operation, the user may run
<cite>sync</cite> prior to writing to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.  This will minimize the
number of dirty objects on the system and create more candidates to be
dropped.</p>
<p>This file is not a means to control the growth of the various kernel caches
(inodes, dentries, pagecache, etc…)  These objects are automatically
reclaimed by the kernel when memory is needed elsewhere on the system.</p>
<p>Use of this file can cause performance problems.  Since it discards cached
objects, it may cost a significant amount of I/O and CPU to recreate the
dropped objects, especially if they were under heavy use.  Because of this,
use outside of a testing or debugging environment is not recommended.</p>
<p>You may see informational messages in your kernel log when this file is
used:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat (1234): drop_caches: 3
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These are informational only.  They do not mean that anything is wrong
with your system.  To disable them, echo 4 (bit 2) into drop_caches.</p>
</section>
<section id="extfrag-threshold">
<h2>extfrag_threshold<a class="headerlink" href="#extfrag-threshold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This parameter affects whether the kernel will compact memory or direct
reclaim to satisfy a high-order allocation. The extfrag/extfrag_index file in
debugfs shows what the fragmentation index for each order is in each zone in
the system. Values tending towards 0 imply allocations would fail due to lack
of memory, values towards 1000 imply failures are due to fragmentation and -1
implies that the allocation will succeed as long as watermarks are met.</p>
<p>The kernel will not compact memory in a zone if the
fragmentation index is &lt;= extfrag_threshold. The default value is 500.</p>
</section>
<section id="highmem-is-dirtyable">
<h2>highmem_is_dirtyable<a class="headerlink" href="#highmem-is-dirtyable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Available only for systems with CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled (32b systems).</p>
<p>This parameter controls whether the high memory is considered for dirty
writers throttling.  This is not the case by default which means that
only the amount of memory directly visible/usable by the kernel can
be dirtied. As a result, on systems with a large amount of memory and
lowmem basically depleted writers might be throttled too early and
streaming writes can get very slow.</p>
<p>Changing the value to non zero would allow more memory to be dirtied
and thus allow writers to write more data which can be flushed to the
storage more effectively. Note this also comes with a risk of pre-mature
OOM killer because some writers (e.g. direct block device writes) can
only use the low memory and they can fill it up with dirty data without
any throttling.</p>

</section>
<section id="legacy-va-layout">
<h2>legacy_va_layout<a class="headerlink" href="#legacy-va-layout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If non-zero, this sysctl disables the new 32-bit mmap layout - the kernel
will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all processes.</p>
</section>
<section id="lowmem-reserve-ratio">
<h2>lowmem_reserve_ratio<a class="headerlink" href="#lowmem-reserve-ratio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For some specialised workloads on highmem machines it is dangerous for
the kernel to allow process memory to be allocated from the “lowmem”
zone.  This is because that memory could then be pinned via the mlock()
system call, or by unavailability of swapspace.</p>
<p>And on large highmem machines this lack of reclaimable lowmem memory
can be fatal.</p>
<p>So the Linux page allocator has a mechanism which prevents allocations
which <em>could</em> use highmem from using too much lowmem.  This means that
a certain amount of lowmem is defended from the possibility of being
captured into pinned user memory.</p>
<p>(The same argument applies to the old 16 megabyte ISA DMA region.  This
mechanism will also defend that region from allocations which could use
highmem or lowmem).</p>
<p>The <cite>lowmem_reserve_ratio</cite> tunable determines how aggressive the kernel is
in defending these lower zones.</p>
<p>If you have a machine which uses highmem or ISA DMA and your
applications are using mlock(), or if you are running with no swap then
you probably should change the lowmem_reserve_ratio setting.</p>
<p>The lowmem_reserve_ratio is an array. You can see them by reading this file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% cat /proc/sys/vm/lowmem_reserve_ratio
256     256     32
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But, these values are not used directly. The kernel calculates # of protection
pages for each zones from them. These are shown as array of protection pages
in /proc/zoneinfo like followings. (This is an example of x86-64 box).
Each zone has an array of protection pages like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Node 0, zone      DMA
  pages free     1355
        min      3
        low      3
        high     4
      :
      :
    numa_other   0
        protection: (0, 2004, 2004, 2004)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  pagesets
    cpu: 0 pcp: 0
        :
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These protections are added to score to judge whether this zone should be used
for page allocation or should be reclaimed.</p>
<p>In this example, if normal pages (index=2) are required to this DMA zone and
watermark[WMARK_HIGH] is used for watermark, the kernel judges this zone should
not be used because pages_free(1355) is smaller than watermark + protection[2]
(4 + 2004 = 2008). If this protection value is 0, this zone would be used for
normal page requirement. If requirement is DMA zone(index=0), protection[0]
(=0) is used.</p>
<p>zone[i]’s protection[j] is calculated by following expression:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(i &lt; j):
  zone[i]-&gt;protection[j]
  = (total sums of managed_pages from zone[i+1] to zone[j] on the node)
    / lowmem_reserve_ratio[i];
(i = j):
   (should not be protected. = 0;
(i &gt; j):
   (not necessary, but looks 0)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The default values of lowmem_reserve_ratio[i] are</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 8%" />
<col style="width: 92%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>256</p></td>
<td><p>(if zone[i] means DMA or DMA32 zone)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>32</p></td>
<td><p>(others)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As above expression, they are reciprocal number of ratio.
256 means 1/256. # of protection pages becomes about “0.39%” of total managed
pages of higher zones on the node.</p>
<p>If you would like to protect more pages, smaller values are effective.
The minimum value is 1 (1/1 -&gt; 100%). The value less than 1 completely
disables protection of the pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="max-map-count">
<h2>max_map_count:<a class="headerlink" href="#max-map-count" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This file contains the maximum number of memory map areas a process
may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of calling
malloc, directly by mmap, mprotect, and madvise, and also when loading
shared libraries.</p>
<p>While most applications need less than a thousand maps, certain
programs, particularly malloc debuggers, may consume lots of them,
e.g., up to one or two maps per allocation.</p>
<p>The default value is 65530.</p>

<section id="memory-failure-early-kill">
<h2>memory_failure_early_kill:<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-failure-early-kill" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Control how to kill processes when uncorrected memory error (typically
a 2bit error in a memory module) is detected in the background by hardware
that cannot be handled by the kernel. In some cases (like the page
still having a valid copy on disk) the kernel will handle the failure
transparently without affecting any applications. But if there is
no other uptodate copy of the data it will kill to prevent any data
corruptions from propagating.</p>
<p>1: Kill all processes that have the corrupted and not reloadable page mapped
as soon as the corruption is detected.  Note this is not supported
for a few types of pages, like kernel internally allocated data or
the swap cache, but works for the majority of user pages.</p>
<p>0: Only unmap the corrupted page from all processes and only kill a process
who tries to access it.</p>
<p>The kill is done using a catchable SIGBUS with BUS_MCEERR_AO, so processes can
handle this if they want to.</p>
<p>This is only active on architectures/platforms with advanced machine
check handling and depends on the hardware capabilities.</p>

<p>This is used to force the Linux VM to keep a minimum number

watermark[WMARK_MIN] value for each lowmem zone in the system.
Each lowmem zone gets a number of reserved free pages based
proportionally on its size.</p>
<p>Some minimal amount of memory is needed to satisfy PF_MEMALLOC
allocations; if you set this to lower than 1024KB, your system will
become subtly broken, and prone to deadlock under high loads.</p>

This insures that the slab growth stays under control even in NUMA
systems that rarely perform global reclaim.</p>

<p>Once enabled, the vmemmap pages of subsequent allocation of HugeTLB pages from

per 1GB HugeTLB page), whereas already allocated HugeTLB pages will not be
optimized.  When those optimized HugeTLB pages are freed from the HugeTLB pool
to the buddy allocator, the vmemmap pages representing that range needs to be
remapped again and the vmemmap pages discarded earlier need to be rellocated
again.  If your use case is that HugeTLB pages are allocated ‘on the fly’ (e.g.
never explicitly allocating HugeTLB pages with ‘nr_hugepages’ but only set
‘nr_overcommit_hugepages’, those overcommitted HugeTLB pages are allocated ‘on
the fly’) instead of being pulled from the HugeTLB pool, you should weigh the
benefits of memory savings against the more overhead (~2x slower than before)
of allocation or freeing HugeTLB pages between the HugeTLB pool and the buddy
allocator.  Another behavior to note is that if the system is under heavy memory
pressure, it could prevent the user from freeing HugeTLB pages from the HugeTLB
pool to the buddy allocator since the allocation of vmemmap pages could be
failed, you have to retry later if your system encounter this situation.</p>
<p>Once disabled, the vmemmap pages of subsequent allocation of HugeTLB pages from
buddy allocator will not be optimized meaning the extra overhead at allocation
time from buddy allocator disappears, whereas already optimized HugeTLB pages
will not be affected.  If you want to make sure there are no optimized HugeTLB
pages, you can set “nr_hugepages” to 0 first and then disable this.  Note that
writing 0 to nr_hugepages will make any “in use” HugeTLB pages become surplus
pages.  So, those surplus pages are still optimized until they are no longer
in use.  You would need to wait for those surplus pages to be released before
there are no optimized pages in the system.</p>

<p>This sysctl is only for NUMA and it is deprecated. Anything but
Node order will fail!</p>
<p>‘where the memory is allocated from’ is controlled by zonelists.</p>
<p>(This documentation ignores ZONE_HIGHMEM/ZONE_DMA32 for simple explanation.
you may be able to read ZONE_DMA as ZONE_DMA32…)</p>
<p>In non-NUMA case, a zonelist for GFP_KERNEL is ordered as following.
ZONE_NORMAL -&gt; ZONE_DMA
This means that a memory allocation request for GFP_KERNEL will
get memory from ZONE_DMA only when ZONE_NORMAL is not available.</p>
<p>In NUMA case, you can think of following 2 types of order.
Assume 2 node NUMA and below is zonelist of Node(0)’s GFP_KERNEL:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(A) Node(0) ZONE_NORMAL -&gt; Node(0) ZONE_DMA -&gt; Node(1) ZONE_NORMAL
(B) Node(0) ZONE_NORMAL -&gt; Node(1) ZONE_NORMAL -&gt; Node(0) ZONE_DMA.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Type(A) offers the best locality for processes on Node(0), but ZONE_DMA
will be used before ZONE_NORMAL exhaustion. This increases possibility of
out-of-memory(OOM) of ZONE_DMA because ZONE_DMA is tend to be small.</p>
<p>Type(B) cannot offer the best locality but is more robust against OOM of
the DMA zone.</p>
<p>Type(A) is called as “Node” order. Type (B) is “Zone” order.</p>
<p>“Node order” orders the zonelists by node, then by zone within each node.
Specify “[Nn]ode” for node order</p>
<p>“Zone Order” orders the zonelists by zone type, then by node within each
zone.  Specify “[Zz]one” for zone order.</p>
<p>Specify “[Dd]efault” to request automatic configuration.</p>
<p>On 32-bit, the Normal zone needs to be preserved for allocations accessible
by the kernel, so “zone” order will be selected.</p>
<p>On 64-bit, devices that require DMA32/DMA are relatively rare, so “node”
order will be selected.</p>
<p>Default order is recommended unless this is causing problems for your
system/application.</p>

<p>This control is used to define the rough relative IO cost of swapping

assumes equal IO cost and will thus apply memory pressure to the page
cache and swap-backed pages equally; lower values signify more
expensive swap IO, higher values indicates cheaper.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that filesystem IO patterns under memory pressure tend to
be more efficient than swap’s random IO. An optimal value will require
experimentation and will also be workload-dependent.</p>
<p>The default value is 60.</p>
<p>For in-memory swap, like zram or zswap, as well as hybrid setups that
have swap on faster devices than the filesystem, values beyond 100 can
be considered. For example, if the random IO against the swap device
is on average 2x faster than IO from the filesystem, swappiness should
be 133 (x + 2x = 200, 2x = 133.33).</p>

<p>This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim
the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects.</p>
<p>At the default value of vfs_cache_pressure=100 the kernel will attempt to
reclaim dentries and inodes at a “fair” rate with respect to pagecache and
swapcache reclaim.  Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer
to retain dentry and inode caches. When vfs_cache_pressure=0, the kernel will
never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily
lead to out-of-memory conditions. Increasing vfs_cache_pressure beyond 100
causes the kernel to prefer to reclaim dentries and inodes.</p>
<p>Increasing vfs_cache_pressure significantly beyond 100 may have negative
performance impact. Reclaim code needs to take various locks to find freeable
directory and inode objects. With vfs_cache_pressure=1000, it will look for
ten times more freeable objects than there are.</p>

<section id="watermark-boost-factor">
<h2>watermark_boost_factor<a class="headerlink" href="#watermark-boost-factor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This factor controls the level of reclaim when memory is being fragmented.
It defines the percentage of the high watermark of a zone that will be
reclaimed if pages of different mobility are being mixed within pageblocks.
The intent is that compaction has less work to do in the future and to
increase the success rate of future high-order allocations such as SLUB
allocations, THP and hugetlbfs pages.</p>
<p>To make it sensible with respect to the watermark_scale_factor
parameter, the unit is in fractions of 10,000. The default value of
15,000 means that up to 150% of the high watermark will be reclaimed in the
event of a pageblock being mixed due to fragmentation. The level of reclaim
is determined by the number of fragmentation events that occurred in the
recent past. If this value is smaller than a pageblock then a pageblocks
worth of pages will be reclaimed (e.g.  2MB on 64-bit x86). A boost factor
of 0 will disable the feature.</p>

<section id="watermark-scale-factor">
<h2>watermark_scale_factor<a class="headerlink" href="#watermark-scale-factor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This factor controls the aggressiveness of kswapd. It defines the
amount of memory left in a node/system before kswapd is woken up and
how much memory needs to be free before kswapd goes back to sleep.</p>
<p>The unit is in fractions of 10,000. The default value of 10 means the
distances between watermarks are 0.1% of the available memory in the
node/system. The maximum value is 3000, or 30% of memory.</p>
<p>A high rate of threads entering direct reclaim (allocstall) or kswapd
going to sleep prematurely (kswapd_low_wmark_hit_quickly) can indicate

<p>zone_reclaim_mode is disabled by default.  For file servers or workloads
that benefit from having their data cached, zone_reclaim_mode should be
left disabled as the caching effect is likely to be more important than
data locality.</p>
<p>Consider enabling one or more zone_reclaim mode bits if it’s known that the
workload is partitioned such that each partition fits within a NUMA node
and that accessing remote memory would cause a measurable performance
reduction.  The page allocator will take additional actions before
allocating off node pages.</p>
<p>Allowing zone reclaim to write out pages stops processes that are
writing large amounts of data from dirtying pages on other nodes. Zone
reclaim will write out dirty pages if a zone fills up and so effectively
throttle the process. This may decrease the performance of a single process
since it cannot use all of system memory to buffer the outgoing writes
anymore but it preserve the memory on other nodes so that the performance
of other processes running on other nodes will not be affected.</p>
<p>Allowing regular swap effectively restricts allocations to the local
node unless explicitly overridden by memory policies or cpuset
configurations.</p>
