<h2>Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Performance critical computing applications dealing with large memory
working sets are already running on top of libhugetlbfs and in turn
hugetlbfs. Transparent HugePage Support (THP) is an alternative mean of
using huge pages for the backing of virtual memory with huge pages
that supports the automatic promotion and demotion of page sizes and
without the shortcomings of hugetlbfs.</p>
<p>Currently THP only works for anonymous memory mappings and tmpfs/shmem.
But in the future it can expand to other filesystems.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>in the examples below we presume that the basic page size is 4K and
the huge page size is 2M, although the actual numbers may vary
depending on the CPU architecture.</p>
</div>
<p>The reason applications are running faster is because of two
factors. The first factor is almost completely irrelevant and it’s not
of significant interest because it’ll also have the downside of
requiring larger clear-page copy-page in page faults which is a
potentially negative effect. The first factor consists in taking a
single page fault for each 2M virtual region touched by userland (so
reducing the enter/exit kernel frequency by a 512 times factor). This
only matters the first time the memory is accessed for the lifetime of
a memory mapping. The second long lasting and much more important
factor will affect all subsequent accesses to the memory for the whole
runtime of the application. The second factor consist of two
components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the TLB miss will run faster (especially with virtualization using
nested pagetables but almost always also on bare metal without
virtualization)</p></li>
<li><p>a single TLB entry will be mapping a much larger amount of virtual
memory in turn reducing the number of TLB misses. With
virtualization and nested pagetables the TLB can be mapped of
larger size only if both KVM and the Linux guest are using
hugepages but a significant speedup already happens if only one of
the two is using hugepages just because of the fact the TLB miss is
going to run faster.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>THP can be enabled system wide or restricted to certain tasks or even
memory ranges inside task’s address space. Unless THP is completely
disabled, there is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">khugepaged</span></code> daemon that scans memory and
collapses sequences of basic pages into huge pages.</p>
<p>The THP behaviour is controlled via <a class="reference internal" href="#thp-sysfs"><span class="std std-ref">sysfs</span></a>
interface and using madvise(2) and prctl(2) system calls.</p>
<p>Transparent Hugepage Support maximizes the usefulness of free memory
if compared to the reservation approach of hugetlbfs by allowing all
unused memory to be used as cache or other movable (or even unmovable
entities). It doesn’t require reservation to prevent hugepage
allocation failures to be noticeable from userland. It allows paging
and all other advanced VM features to be available on the
hugepages. It requires no modifications for applications to take
advantage of it.</p>
<p>Applications however can be further optimized to take advantage of
this feature, like for example they’ve been optimized before to avoid
a flood of mmap system calls for every malloc(4k). Optimizing userland
is by far not mandatory and khugepaged already can take care of long
lived page allocations even for hugepage unaware applications that
deals with large amounts of memory.</p>
<p>In certain cases when hugepages are enabled system wide, application
may end up allocating more memory resources. An application may mmap a
large region but only touch 1 byte of it, in that case a 2M page might
be allocated instead of a 4k page for no good. This is why it’s
possible to disable hugepages system-wide and to only have them inside
MADV_HUGEPAGE madvise regions.</p>
<p>Embedded systems should enable hugepages only inside madvise regions
to eliminate any risk of wasting any precious byte of memory and to
only run faster.</p>
<p>Applications that gets a lot of benefit from hugepages and that don’t
risk to lose memory by using hugepages, should use
madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) on their critical mmapped regions.</p>

<section id="global-thp-controls">
<h3>Global THP controls<a class="headerlink" href="#global-thp-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Transparent Hugepage Support for anonymous memory can be entirely disabled
(mostly for debugging purposes) or only enabled inside MADV_HUGEPAGE
regions (to avoid the risk of consuming more memory resources) or enabled
system wide. This can be achieved with one of:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo always &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo madvise &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo never &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s also possible to limit defrag efforts in the VM to generate
anonymous hugepages in case they’re not immediately free to madvise
regions or to never try to defrag memory and simply fallback to regular
pages unless hugepages are immediately available. Clearly if we spend CPU
time to defrag memory, we would expect to gain even more by the fact we
use hugepages later instead of regular pages. This isn’t always
guaranteed, but it may be more likely in case the allocation is for a
MADV_HUGEPAGE region.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo always &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo defer &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo defer+madvise &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo madvise &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo never &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
</pre></div>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>always</dt><dd><p>means that an application requesting THP will stall on
allocation failure and directly reclaim pages and compact
memory in an effort to allocate a THP immediately. This may be
desirable for virtual machines that benefit heavily from THP
use and are willing to delay the VM start to utilise them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>defer</dt><dd><p>means that an application will wake kswapd in the background
to reclaim pages and wake kcompactd to compact memory so that
THP is available in the near future. It’s the responsibility
of khugepaged to then install the THP pages later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>defer+madvise</dt><dd><p>will enter direct reclaim and compaction like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">always</span></code>, but
only for regions that have used madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE); all
other regions will wake kswapd in the background to reclaim
pages and wake kcompactd to compact memory so that THP is
available in the near future.</p>
</dd>
<dt>madvise</dt><dd><p>will enter direct reclaim like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">always</span></code> but only for regions
that are have used madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE). This is the default
behaviour.</p>
</dd>
<dt>never</dt><dd><p>should be self-explanatory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By default kernel tries to use huge zero page on read page fault to
anonymous mapping. It’s possible to disable huge zero page by writing 0
or enable it back by writing 1:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 0 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/use_zero_page
echo 1 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/use_zero_page
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some userspace (such as a test program, or an optimized memory allocation
library) may want to know the size (in bytes) of a transparent hugepage:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hpage_pmd_size
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>khugepaged will be automatically started when
transparent_hugepage/enabled is set to “always” or “madvise, and it’ll
be automatically shutdown if it’s set to “never”.</p>
</section>
<section id="khugepaged-controls">
<h3>Khugepaged controls<a class="headerlink" href="#khugepaged-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>khugepaged runs usually at low frequency so while one may not want to
invoke defrag algorithms synchronously during the page faults, it
should be worth invoking defrag at least in khugepaged. However it’s
also possible to disable defrag in khugepaged by writing 0 or enable
defrag in khugepaged by writing 1:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 0 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
echo 1 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can also control how many pages khugepaged should scan at each
pass:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/pages_to_scan
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and how many milliseconds to wait in khugepaged between each pass (you
can set this to 0 to run khugepaged at 100% utilization of one core):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/scan_sleep_millisecs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and how many milliseconds to wait in khugepaged if there’s an hugepage
allocation failure to throttle the next allocation attempt:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/alloc_sleep_millisecs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The khugepaged progress can be seen in the number of pages collapsed (note
that this counter may not be an exact count of the number of pages
collapsed, since “collapsed” could mean multiple things: (1) A PTE mapping
being replaced by a PMD mapping, or (2) All 4K physical pages replaced by
one 2M hugepage. Each may happen independently, or together, depending on
the type of memory and the failures that occur. As such, this value should
be interpreted roughly as a sign of progress, and counters in /proc/vmstat
consulted for more accurate accounting):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/pages_collapsed
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>for each pass:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/full_scans
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_ptes_none</span></code> specifies how many extra small pages (that are
not already mapped) can be allocated when collapsing a group
of small pages into one large page:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/max_ptes_none
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A higher value leads to use additional memory for programs.
A lower value leads to gain less thp performance. Value of
max_ptes_none can waste cpu time very little, you can
ignore it.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_ptes_swap</span></code> specifies how many pages can be brought in from
swap when collapsing a group of pages into a transparent huge page:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/max_ptes_swap
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A higher value can cause excessive swap IO and waste
memory. A lower value can prevent THPs from being
collapsed, resulting fewer pages being collapsed into
THPs, and lower memory access performance.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_ptes_shared</span></code> specifies how many pages can be shared across multiple
processes. Exceeding the number would block the collapse:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/max_ptes_shared
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A higher value may increase memory footprint for some workloads.</p>

<h2>Hugepages in tmpfs/shmem<a class="headerlink" href="#hugepages-in-tmpfs-shmem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can control hugepage allocation policy in tmpfs with mount option
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">huge=</span></code>. It can have following values:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>always</dt><dd><p>Attempt to allocate huge pages every time we need a new page;</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mount</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">remount,huge=</span> <span class="pre">/mountpoint</span></code> works fine after mount: remounting

<p>There’s also sysfs knob to control hugepage allocation policy for internal
shmem mount: /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled. The mount
is used for SysV SHM, memfds, shared anonymous mmaps (of /dev/zero or
MAP_ANONYMOUS), GPU drivers’ DRM objects, Ashmem.</p>
<p>In addition to policies listed above, shmem_enabled allows two further
values:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>deny</dt><dd><p>For use in emergencies, to force the huge option off from

</dd>
<dt>force</dt><dd><p>Force the huge option on for all - very useful for testing;</p>

application that could have been using hugepages. This also applies to the
regions registered in khugepaged.</p>

<p>There are a number of counters in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/proc/vmstat</span></code> that may be used to

This action implies splitting all PMD the page mapped with.</p>
</dd>
<dt>thp_split_page_failed</dt><dd><p>is incremented if kernel fails to split huge
page. This can happen if the page was pinned by somebody.</p>
</dd>
<dt>thp_deferred_split_page</dt><dd><p>is incremented when a huge page is put onto split

splitting it would free up some memory. Pages on split queue are
going to be split under memory pressure.</p>
</dd>
<dt>thp_split_pmd</dt><dd><p>is incremented every time a PMD split into table of PTEs.

page table entry.</p>
</dd>

<p>As the system ages, allocating huge pages may be expensive as the
system uses memory compaction to copy data around memory to free a
huge page for use. There are some counters in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/proc/vmstat</span></code> to help
monitor this overhead.</p>

<p>It is possible to establish how long the stalls were using the function
tracer to record how long was spent in __alloc_pages() and
using the mm_page_alloc tracepoint to identify which allocations were
