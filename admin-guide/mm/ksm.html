<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KSM is a memory-saving de-duplication feature, enabled by CONFIG_KSM=y,
added to the Linux kernel in 2.6.32.  See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mm/ksm.c</span></code> for its implementation,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/306704/">http://lwn.net/Articles/306704/</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/330589/">https://lwn.net/Articles/330589/</a></p>
<p>KSM was originally developed for use with KVM (where it was known as
Kernel Shared Memory), to fit more virtual machines into physical memory,
by sharing the data common between them.  But it can be useful to any
application which generates many instances of the same data.</p>
<p>The KSM daemon ksmd periodically scans those areas of user memory
which have been registered with it, looking for pages of identical
content which can be replaced by a single write-protected page (which
is automatically copied if a process later wants to update its
content). The amount of pages that KSM daemon scans in a single pass
and the time between the passes are configured using <a class="reference internal" href="#ksm-sysfs"><span class="std std-ref">sysfs
intraface</span></a></p>
<p>KSM only merges anonymous (private) pages, never pagecache (file) pages.
KSM’s merged pages were originally locked into kernel memory, but can now
be swapped out just like other user pages (but sharing is broken when they
are swapped back in: ksmd must rediscover their identity and merge again).</p>
</section>
<section id="controlling-ksm-with-madvise">
<h2>Controlling KSM with madvise<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-ksm-with-madvise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KSM only operates on those areas of address space which an application
has advised to be likely candidates for merging, by using the madvise(2)
system call:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int madvise(addr, length, MADV_MERGEABLE)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The app may call</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int madvise(addr, length, MADV_UNMERGEABLE)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to cancel that advice and restore unshared pages: whereupon KSM
unmerges whatever it merged in that range.  Note: this unmerging call
may suddenly require more memory than is available - possibly failing
with EAGAIN, but more probably arousing the Out-Of-Memory killer.</p>
<p>If KSM is not configured into the running kernel, madvise MADV_MERGEABLE
and MADV_UNMERGEABLE simply fail with EINVAL.  If the running kernel was
built with CONFIG_KSM=y, those calls will normally succeed: even if the
KSM daemon is not currently running, MADV_MERGEABLE still registers
the range for whenever the KSM daemon is started; even if the range
cannot contain any pages which KSM could actually merge; even if
MADV_UNMERGEABLE is applied to a range which was never MADV_MERGEABLE.</p>
<p>If a region of memory must be split into at least one new MADV_MERGEABLE
or MADV_UNMERGEABLE region, the madvise may return ENOMEM if the process
will exceed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vm.max_map_count</span></code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../sysctl/vm.html"><span class="doc">Documentation for /proc/sys/vm/</span></a>).</p>
<p>Like other madvise calls, they are intended for use on mapped areas of
the user address space: they will report ENOMEM if the specified range
includes unmapped gaps (though working on the intervening mapped areas),
and might fail with EAGAIN if not enough memory for internal structures.</p>
<p>Applications should be considerate in their use of MADV_MERGEABLE,
restricting its use to areas likely to benefit.  KSM’s scans may use a lot
of processing power: some installations will disable KSM for that reason.</p>

<p>Default: 20 (chosen for demonstration purposes)</p>
</dd>
<dt>merge_across_nodes</dt><dd><p>specifies if pages from different NUMA nodes can be merged.
When set to 0, ksm merges only pages which physically reside
in the memory area of same NUMA node. That brings lower
latency to access of shared pages. Systems with more nodes, at
significant NUMA distances, are likely to benefit from the
lower latency of setting 0. Smaller systems, which need to
minimize memory usage, are likely to benefit from the greater
sharing of setting 1 (default). You may wish to compare how
your system performs under each setting, before deciding on
which to use. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">merge_across_nodes</span></code> setting can be changed only
when there are no ksm shared pages in the system: set run 2 to
unmerge pages first, then to 1 after changing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">merge_across_nodes</span></code>, to remerge according to the new setting.</p>

CONFIG_SYSFS is disabled)</p>
</dd>
<dt>use_zero_pages</dt><dd><p>specifies whether empty pages (i.e. allocated pages that only
contain zeroes) should be treated specially.  When set to 1,
empty pages are merged with the kernel zero page(s) instead of
with each other as it would happen normally. This can improve
the performance on architectures with coloured zero pages,
depending on the workload. Care should be taken when enabling
this setting, as it can potentially degrade the performance of
KSM for some workloads, for example if the checksums of pages
candidate for merging match the checksum of an empty
page. This setting can be changed at any time, it is only
effective for pages merged after the change.</p>
<p>Default: 0 (normal KSM behaviour as in earlier releases)</p>
</dd>
<dt>max_page_sharing</dt><dd><p>Maximum sharing allowed for each KSM page. This enforces a
deduplication limit to avoid high latency for virtual memory
operations that involve traversal of the virtual mappings that
share the KSM page. The minimum value is 2 as a newly created
KSM page will have at least two sharers. The higher this value
the faster KSM will merge the memory and the higher the
deduplication factor will be, but the slower the worst case
virtual mappings traversal could be for any given KSM
page. Slowing down this traversal means there will be higher
latency for certain virtual memory operations happening during
swapping, compaction, NUMA balancing and page migration, in
turn decreasing responsiveness for the caller of those virtual
memory operations. The scheduler latency of other tasks not
involved with the VM operations doing the virtual mappings
traversal is not affected by this parameter as these
traversals are always schedule friendly themselves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stable_node_chains_prune_millisecs</dt><dd><p>specifies how frequently KSM checks the metadata of the pages
that hit the deduplication limit for stale information.
Smaller milllisecs values will free up the KSM metadata with
lower latency, but they will make ksmd use more CPU during the
scan. It’s a noop if not a single KSM page hit the

<p>A high ratio of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_sharing</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_shared</span></code> indicates good

indicates wasted effort.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_volatile</span></code> embraces several
different kinds of activity, but a high proportion there would also
indicate poor use of madvise MADV_MERGEABLE.</p>
<p>The maximum possible <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_sharing/pages_shared</span></code> ratio is limited by the

<section id="monitoring-ksm-profit">
<h2>Monitoring KSM profit<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-ksm-profit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KSM can save memory by merging identical pages, but also can consume
additional memory, because it needs to generate a number of rmap_items to
save each scanned page’s brief rmap information. Some of these pages may
be merged, but some may not be abled to be merged after being checked
several times, which are unprofitable memory consumed.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>How to determine whether KSM save memory or consume memory in system-wide
range? Here is a simple approximate calculation for reference:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>general_profit =~ pages_sharing * sizeof(page) - (all_rmap_items) *
                  sizeof(rmap_item);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where all_rmap_items can be easily obtained by summing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_sharing</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_shared</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_unshared</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pages_volatile</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The KSM profit inner a single process can be similarly obtained by the
following approximate calculation:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>process_profit =~ ksm_merging_pages * sizeof(page) -
                  ksm_rmap_items * sizeof(rmap_item).
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where ksm_merging_pages is shown under the directory <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/</span></code>,
and ksm_rmap_items is shown in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/ksm_stat</span></code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the perspective of application, a high ratio of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ksm_rmap_items</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ksm_merging_pages</span></code> means a bad madvise-applied policy, so developers or
administrators have to rethink how to change madvise policy. Giving an example
for reference, a page’s size is usually 4K, and the rmap_item’s size is
separately 32B on 32-bit CPU architecture and 64B on 64-bit CPU architecture.
so if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ksm_rmap_items/ksm_merging_pages</span></code> ratio exceeds 64 on 64-bit CPU
or exceeds 128 on 32-bit CPU, then the app’s madvise policy should be dropped,
because the ksm profit is approximately zero or negative.</p>

<section id="monitoring-ksm-events">
<h2>Monitoring KSM events<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-ksm-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some counters in /proc/vmstat that may be used to monitor KSM events.
KSM might help save memory, it’s a tradeoff by may suffering delay on KSM COW
or on swapping in copy. Those events could help users evaluate whether or how
to use KSM. For example, if cow_ksm increases too fast, user may decrease the
range of madvise(, , MADV_MERGEABLE).</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>cow_ksm</dt><dd><p>is incremented every time a KSM page triggers copy on write (COW)
when users try to write to a KSM page, we have to make a copy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ksm_swpin_copy</dt><dd><p>is incremented every time a KSM page is copied when swapping in
note that KSM page might be copied when swapping in because do_swap_page()
cannot do all the locking needed to reconstitute a cross-anon_vma KSM page.</p>
