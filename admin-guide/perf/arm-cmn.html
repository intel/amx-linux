<h1>Arm Coherent Mesh Network PMU<a class="headerlink" href="#arm-coherent-mesh-network-pmu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>CMN-600 is a configurable mesh interconnect consisting of a rectangular
grid of crosspoints (XPs), with each crosspoint supporting up to two
device ports to which various AMBA CHI agents are attached.</p>
<p>CMN implements a distributed PMU design as part of its debug and trace
functionality. This consists of a local monitor (DTM) at every XP, which
counts up to 4 event signals from the connected device nodes and/or the
XP itself. Overflow from these local counters is accumulated in up to 8
global counters implemented by the main controller (DTC), which provides
overall PMU control and interrupts for global counter overflow.</p>
<section id="pmu-events">
<h2>PMU events<a class="headerlink" href="#pmu-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The PMU driver registers a single PMU device for the whole interconnect,
see /sys/bus/event_source/devices/arm_cmn_0. Multi-chip systems may link
more than one CMN together via external CCIX links - in this situation,
each mesh counts its own events entirely independently, and additional
PMU devices will be named arm_cmn_{1..n}.</p>
<p>Most events are specified in a format based directly on the TRM
definitions - “type” selects the respective node type, and “eventid” the
event number. Some events require an additional occupancy ID, which is
specified by “occupid”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since RN-D nodes do not have any distinct events from RN-I nodes, they
are treated as the same type (0xa), and the common event templates are
named “rnid_*”.</p></li>
<li><p>The cycle counter is treated as a synthetic event belonging to the DTC
node (“type” == 0x3, “eventid” is ignored).</p></li>
<li><p>XP events also encode the port and channel in the “eventid” field, to
match the underlying pmu_event0_id encoding for the pmu_event_sel
register. The event templates are named with prefixes to cover all
permutations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By default each event provides an aggregate count over all nodes of the
given type. To target a specific node, “bynodeid” must be set to 1 and
“nodeid” to the appropriate value derived from the CMN configuration
(as defined in the “Node ID Mapping” section of the TRM).</p>
</section>
<section id="watchpoints">
<h2>Watchpoints<a class="headerlink" href="#watchpoints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The PMU can also count watchpoint events to monitor specific flit
traffic. Watchpoints are treated as a synthetic event type, and like PMU
events can be global or targeted with a particular XP’s “nodeid” value.
Since the watchpoint direction is otherwise implicit in the underlying
register selection, separate events are provided for flit uploads and
downloads.</p>
<p>The flit match value and mask are passed in config1 and config2 (“val”
and “mask” respectively). “wp_dev_sel”, “wp_chn_sel”, “wp_grp” and
“wp_exclusive” are specified per the TRM definitions for dtm_wp_config0.
Where a watchpoint needs to match fields from both match groups on the
REQ or SNP channel, it can be specified as two events - one for each
group - with the same nonzero “combine” value. The count for such a
pair of combined events will be attributed to the primary match.
Watchpoint events with a “combine” value of 0 are considered independent
and will count individually.</p>
