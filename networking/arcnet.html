<p>These are the ARCnet drivers for Linux.</p>
<p>This new release (2.91) has been put together by David Woodhouse
&lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:dwmw2&#37;&#52;&#48;infradead&#46;org">dwmw2<span>&#64;</span>infradead<span>&#46;</span>org</a>&gt;, in an attempt to tidy up the driver after adding support
for yet another chipset. Now the generic support has been separated from the
individual chipset drivers, and the source files aren’t quite so packed with
#ifdefs! I’ve changed this file a bit, but kept it in the first person from
Avery, because I didn’t want to completely rewrite it.</p>
<p>The previous release resulted from many months of on-and-off effort from me
(Avery Pennarun), many bug reports/fixes and suggestions from others, and in
particular a lot of input and coding from Tomasz Motylewski.  Starting with
ARCnet 2.10 ALPHA, Tomasz’s all-new-and-improved RFC1051 support has been
included and seems to be working fine!</p>

<section id="installing-the-driver">
<h2>Installing the Driver<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-the-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All you will need to do in order to install the driver is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make config
        (be sure to choose ARCnet in the network devices
        and at least one chipset driver.)
make clean
make zImage
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you obtained this ARCnet package as an upgrade to the ARCnet driver in
your current kernel, you will need to first copy arcnet.c over the one in
the linux/drivers/net directory.</p>
<p>You will know the driver is installed properly if you get some ARCnet
messages when you reboot into the new Linux kernel.</p>
<p>There are four chipset options:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Standard ARCnet COM90xx chipset.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the normal ARCnet card, which you’ve probably got. This is the only
chipset driver which will autoprobe if not told where the card is.
It following options on the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>com90xx=[&lt;io&gt;[,&lt;irq&gt;[,&lt;shmem&gt;]]][,&lt;name&gt;] | &lt;name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you load the chipset support as a module, the options are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>io=&lt;io&gt; irq=&lt;irq&gt; shmem=&lt;shmem&gt; device=&lt;name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To disable the autoprobe, just specify “com90xx=” on the kernel command line.
To specify the name alone, but allow autoprobe, just put “com90xx=&lt;name&gt;”</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>ARCnet COM20020 chipset.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the new chipset from SMC with support for promiscuous mode (packet
sniffing), extra diagnostic information, etc. Unfortunately, there is no
sensible method of autoprobing for these cards. You must specify the I/O
address on the kernel command line.</p>
<p>The command line options are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>com20020=&lt;io&gt;[,&lt;irq&gt;[,&lt;node_ID&gt;[,backplane[,CKP[,timeout]]]]][,name]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you load the chipset support as a module, the options are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>io=&lt;io&gt; irq=&lt;irq&gt; node=&lt;node_ID&gt; backplane=&lt;backplane&gt; clock=&lt;CKP&gt;
timeout=&lt;timeout&gt; device=&lt;name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The COM20020 chipset allows you to set the node ID in software, overriding the
default which is still set in DIP switches on the card. If you don’t have the
COM20020 data sheets, and you don’t know what the other three options refer
to, then they won’t interest you - forget them.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>ARCnet COM90xx chipset in IO-mapped mode.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This will also work with the normal ARCnet cards, but doesn’t use the shared
memory. It performs less well than the above driver, but is provided in case
you have a card which doesn’t support shared memory, or (strangely) in case
you have so many ARCnet cards in your machine that you run out of shmem slots.
If you don’t give the IO address on the kernel command line, then the driver
will not find the card.</p>
<p>The command line options are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>com90io=&lt;io&gt;[,&lt;irq&gt;][,&lt;name&gt;]
</pre></div>
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>If you load the chipset support as a module, the options are:</dt><dd><p>io=&lt;io&gt; irq=&lt;irq&gt; device=&lt;name&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>ARCnet RIM I cards.</p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are COM90xx chips which are _completely_ memory mapped. The support for
these is not tested. If you have one, please mail the author with a success
report. All options must be specified, except the device name.
Command line options:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>arcrimi=&lt;shmem&gt;,&lt;irq&gt;,&lt;node_ID&gt;[,&lt;name&gt;]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you load the chipset support as a module, the options are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shmem=&lt;shmem&gt; irq=&lt;irq&gt; node=&lt;node_ID&gt; device=&lt;name&gt;

<section id="loadable-module-support">
<h2>Loadable Module Support<a class="headerlink" href="#loadable-module-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Configure and rebuild Linux.  When asked, answer ‘m’ to “Generic ARCnet
support” and to support for your ARCnet chipset if you want to use the
loadable module. You can also say ‘y’ to “Generic ARCnet support” and ‘m’
to the chipset support if you wish.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make config

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you’re using a loadable module, you need to use insmod to load it, and
you can specify various characteristics of your card on the command
line.  (In recent versions of the driver, autoprobing is much more reliable
and works as a module, so most of this is now unnecessary.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cd /usr/src/linux/modules
insmod arcnet.o
insmod com90xx.o
insmod com20020.o io=0x2e0 device=eth1

<h2>Using the Driver<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you build your kernel with ARCnet COM90xx support included, it should
probe for your card automatically when you boot. If you use a different
chipset driver complied into the kernel, you must give the necessary options
on the kernel command line, as detailed above.</p>
<p>Go read the NET-2-HOWTO and ETHERNET-HOWTO for Linux; they should be
available where you picked up this driver.  Think of your ARCnet as a
souped-up (or down, as the case may be) Ethernet card.</p>
<p>By the way, be sure to change all references from “eth0” to “arc0” in the
HOWTOs.  Remember that ARCnet isn’t a “true” Ethernet, and the device name
is DIFFERENT.</p>

<section id="multiple-cards-in-one-computer">
<h2>Multiple Cards in One Computer<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-cards-in-one-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Linux has pretty good support for this now, but since I’ve been busy, the
ARCnet driver has somewhat suffered in this respect. COM90xx support, if
compiled into the kernel, will (try to) autodetect all the installed cards.</p>
<p>If you have other cards, with support compiled into the kernel, then you can
just repeat the options on the kernel command line, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>LILO: linux com20020=0x2e0 com20020=0x380 com90io=0x260
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have the chipset support built as a loadable module, then you need to
do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>insmod -o arc0 com90xx
insmod -o arc1 com20020 io=0x2e0
insmod -o arc2 com90xx
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ARCnet drivers will now sort out their names automatically.</p>

<h2>Using Multiprotocol ARCnet<a class="headerlink" href="#using-multiprotocol-arcnet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ARCnet driver v2.10 ALPHA supports three protocols, each on its own
“virtual network device”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 9%" />
<col style="width: 91%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>arc0</p></td>
<td><p>RFC1201 protocol, the official Internet standard which just
happens to be 100% compatible with Novell’s TRXNET driver.
Version 1.00 of the ARCnet driver supported _only_ this
protocol.  arc0 is the fastest of the three protocols (for
whatever reason), and allows larger packets to be used
because it supports RFC1201 “packet splitting” operations.
Unless you have a specific need to use a different protocol,
I strongly suggest that you stick with this one.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>arc0e</p></td>
<td><p>“Ethernet-Encapsulation” which sends packets over ARCnet
that are actually a lot like Ethernet packets, including the
6-byte hardware addresses.  This protocol is compatible with
Microsoft’s NDIS ARCnet driver, like the one in WfWg and
LANMAN.  Because the MTU of 493 is actually smaller than the
one “required” by TCP/IP (576), there is a chance that some
network operations will not function properly.  The Linux
TCP/IP layer can compensate in most cases, however, by
automatically fragmenting the TCP/IP packets to make them
fit.  arc0e also works slightly more slowly than arc0, for
reasons yet to be determined.  (Probably it’s the smaller
MTU that does it.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>arc0s</p></td>
<td><p>The “[s]imple” RFC1051 protocol is the “previous” Internet
standard that is completely incompatible with the new
standard.  Some software today, however, continues to
support the old standard (and only the old standard)
including NetBSD and AmiTCP.  RFC1051 also does not support
RFC1201’s packet splitting, and the MTU of 507 is still
smaller than the Internet “requirement,” so it’s quite
possible that you may run into problems.  It’s also slower
than RFC1201 by about 25%, for the same reason as arc0e.</p>
<p>The arc0s support was contributed by Tomasz Motylewski
and modified somewhat by me.  Bugs are probably my fault.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can choose not to compile arc0e and arc0s into the driver if you want -
this will save you a bit of memory and avoid confusion when eg. trying to
use the “NFS-root” stuff in recent Linux kernels.</p>
<p>The arc0e and arc0s devices are created automatically when you first
ifconfig the arc0 device.  To actually use them, though, you need to also
ifconfig the other virtual devices you need.  There are a number of ways you
can set up your network then:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Single Protocol.</p>
<p>This is the simplest way to configure your network: use just one of the
two available protocols.  As mentioned above, it’s a good idea to use
only arc0 unless you have a good reason (like some other software, ie.
WfWg, that only works with arc0e).</p>
<p>If you need only arc0, then the following commands should get you going:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0 MY.IP.ADD.RESS
route add MY.IP.ADD.RESS arc0
route add -net SUB.NET.ADD.RESS arc0
[add other local routes here]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you need arc0e (and only arc0e), it’s a little different:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0 MY.IP.ADD.RESS
ifconfig arc0e MY.IP.ADD.RESS
route add MY.IP.ADD.RESS arc0e
route add -net SUB.NET.ADD.RESS arc0e
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>arc0s works much the same way as arc0e.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More than one protocol on the same wire.</p>
<p>Now things start getting confusing.  To even try it, you may need to be
partly crazy.  Here’s what <em>I</em> did. :) Note that I don’t include arc0s in
my home network; I don’t have any NetBSD or AmiTCP computers, so I only
use arc0s during limited testing.</p>
<p>I have three computers on my home network; two Linux boxes (which prefer
RFC1201 protocol, for reasons listed above), and one XT that can’t run
Linux but runs the free Microsoft LANMAN Client instead.</p>
<p>Worse, one of the Linux computers (freedom) also has a modem and acts as
a router to my Internet provider.  The other Linux box (insight) also has
its own IP address and needs to use freedom as its default gateway.  The
XT (patience), however, does not have its own Internet IP address and so
I assigned it one on a “private subnet” (as defined by RFC1597).</p>
<p>To start with, take a simple network with just insight and freedom.
Insight needs to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>talk to freedom via RFC1201 (arc0) protocol, because I like it
more and it’s faster.</p></li>
<li><p>use freedom as its Internet gateway.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty easy to do.  Set up insight like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0 insight
route add insight arc0
route add freedom arc0  /* I would use the subnet here (like I said
                                to in &quot;single protocol&quot; above),
                                but the rest of the subnet
                                unfortunately lies across the PPP
                                link on freedom, which confuses
                                things. */
route add default gw freedom
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And freedom gets configured like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0 freedom
route add freedom arc0
route add insight arc0
/* and default gateway is configured by pppd */
</pre></div>

<p>Great, now insight talks to freedom directly on arc0, and sends packets
to the Internet through freedom.  If you didn’t know how to do the above,
you should probably stop reading this section now because it only gets
worse.</p>
<p>Now, how do I add patience into the network?  It will be using LANMAN
Client, which means I need the arc0e device.  It needs to be able to talk
to both insight and freedom, and also use freedom as a gateway to the
Internet.  (Recall that patience has a “private IP address” which won’t
work on the Internet; that’s okay, I configured Linux IP masquerading on
freedom for this subnet).</p>
<p>So patience (necessarily; I don’t have another IP number from my
provider) has an IP address on a different subnet than freedom and
insight, but needs to use freedom as an Internet gateway.  Worse, most
DOS networking programs, including LANMAN, have braindead networking
schemes that rely completely on the netmask and a ‘default gateway’ to
determine how to route packets.  This means that to get to freedom or
insight, patience WILL send through its default gateway, regardless of
the fact that both freedom and insight (courtesy of the arc0e device)
could understand a direct transmission.</p>
<p>I compensate by giving freedom an extra IP address - aliased ‘gatekeeper’ -
that is on my private subnet, the same subnet that patience is on.  I
then define gatekeeper to be the default gateway for patience.</p>
<p>To configure freedom (in addition to the commands above):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0e gatekeeper
route add gatekeeper arc0e
route add patience arc0e
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This way, freedom will send all packets for patience through arc0e,
giving its IP address as gatekeeper (on the private subnet).  When it
talks to insight or the Internet, it will use its “freedom” Internet IP
address.</p>
<p>You will notice that we haven’t configured the arc0e device on insight.
This would work, but is not really necessary, and would require me to
assign insight another special IP number from my private subnet.  Since
both insight and patience are using freedom as their default gateway, the
two can already talk to each other.</p>
<p>It’s quite fortunate that I set things up like this the first time (cough
cough) because it’s really handy when I boot insight into DOS.  There, it
runs the Novell ODI protocol stack, which only works with RFC1201 ARCnet.
In this mode it would be impossible for insight to communicate directly
with patience, since the Novell stack is incompatible with Microsoft’s
Ethernet-Encap.  Without changing any settings on freedom or patience, I
simply set freedom as the default gateway for insight (now in DOS,
remember) and all the forwarding happens “automagically” between the two
hosts that would normally not be able to communicate at all.</p>
<p>For those who like diagrams, I have created two “virtual subnets” on the
same physical ARCnet wire.  You can picture it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    [RFC1201 NETWORK]                   [ETHER-ENCAP NETWORK]
(registered Internet subnet)           (RFC1597 private subnet)

                       (IP Masquerade)

<h2>It works: what now?<a class="headerlink" href="#it-works-what-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Send mail describing your setup, preferably including driver version, kernel
version, ARCnet card model, CPU type, number of systems on your network, and
list of software in use to me at the following address:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference external" href="mailto:apenwarr&#37;&#52;&#48;worldvisions&#46;ca">apenwarr<span>&#64;</span>worldvisions<span>&#46;</span>ca</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I do send (sometimes automated) replies to all messages I receive.  My email
can be weird (and also usually gets forwarded all over the place along the
way to me), so if you don’t get a reply within a reasonable time, please
resend.</p>

<section id="it-doesn-t-work-what-now">
<h2>It doesn’t work: what now?<a class="headerlink" href="#it-doesn-t-work-what-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do the same as above, but also include the output of the ifconfig and route
commands, as well as any pertinent log entries (ie. anything that starts
with “arcnet:” and has shown up since the last reboot) in your mail.</p>
<p>If you want to try fixing it yourself (I strongly recommend that you mail me
about the problem first, since it might already have been solved) you may
want to try some of the debug levels available.  For heavy testing on
D_DURING or more, it would be a REALLY good idea to kill your klogd daemon
first!  D_DURING displays 4-5 lines for each packet sent or received.  D_TX,
D_RX, and D_SKB actually DISPLAY each packet as it is sent or received,
which is obviously quite big.</p>
<p>Starting with v2.40 ALPHA, the autoprobe routines have changed
significantly.  In particular, they won’t tell you why the card was not
found unless you turn on the D_INIT_REASONS debugging flag.</p>
<p>Once the driver is running, you can run the arcdump shell script (available
from me or in the full ARCnet package, if you have it) as root to list the
contents of the arcnet buffers at any time.  To make any sense at all out of
this, you should grab the pertinent RFCs. (some are listed near the top of
arcnet.c).  arcdump assumes your card is at 0xD0000.  If it isn’t, edit the
script.</p>
<p>Buffers 0 and 1 are used for receiving, and Buffers 2 and 3 are for sending.
Ping-pong buffers are implemented both ways.</p>
<p>If your debug level includes D_DURING and you did NOT define SLOW_XMIT_COPY,
the buffers are cleared to a constant value of 0x42 every time the card is
reset (which should only happen when you do an ifconfig up, or when Linux
decides that the driver is broken).  During a transmit, unused parts of the
buffer will be cleared to 0x42 as well.  This is to make it easier to figure
out which bytes are being used by a packet.</p>
<p>You can change the debug level without recompiling the kernel by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ifconfig arc0 down metric 1xxx
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where “xxx” is the debug level you want.  For example, “metric 1015” would put
you at debug level 15.  Debug level 7 is currently the default.</p>
<p>Note that the debug level is (starting with v1.90 ALPHA) a binary
combination of different debug flags; so debug level 7 is really 1+2+4 or
D_NORMAL+D_EXTRA+D_INIT.  To include D_DURING, you would add 16 to this,
resulting in debug level 23.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand that, you probably don’t want to know anyway.
E-mail me about your problem.</p>
