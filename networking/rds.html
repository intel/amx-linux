<h2>RDS Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#rds-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>RDS provides reliable, ordered datagram delivery by using a single
reliable connection between any two nodes in the cluster. This allows
applications to use a single socket to talk to any other process in the
cluster - so in a cluster with N processes you need N sockets, in contrast
to N*N if you use a connection-oriented socket transport like TCP.</p>
<p>RDS is not Infiniband-specific; it was designed to support different
transports.  The current implementation used to support RDS over TCP as well
as IB.</p>
<p>The high-level semantics of RDS from the application’s point of view are</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Addressing</p>
<p>RDS uses IPv4 addresses and 16bit port numbers to identify
the end point of a connection. All socket operations that involve
passing addresses between kernel and user space generally
use a struct sockaddr_in.</p>
<p>The fact that IPv4 addresses are used does not mean the underlying
transport has to be IP-based. In fact, RDS over IB uses a
reliable IB connection; the IP address is used exclusively to
locate the remote node’s GID (by ARPing for the given IP).</p>
<p>The port space is entirely independent of UDP, TCP or any other
protocol.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Socket interface</p>
<p>RDS sockets work <em>mostly</em> as you would expect from a BSD
socket. The next section will cover the details. At any rate,
all I/O is performed through the standard BSD socket API.
Some additions like zerocopy support are implemented through
control messages, while other extensions use the getsockopt/
setsockopt calls.</p>
<p>Sockets must be bound before you can send or receive data.
This is needed because binding also selects a transport and
attaches it to the socket. Once bound, the transport assignment
does not change. RDS will tolerate IPs moving around (eg in
a active-active HA scenario), but only as long as the address
doesn’t move to a different transport.</p>
</li>
<li><p>sysctls</p>
<p>RDS supports a number of sysctls in /proc/sys/net/rds</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Socket Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#socket-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

You are not allowed to queue more than SO_SNDSIZE bytes to
a socket. A message is queued when sendmsg is called, and
it leaves the queue when the remote system acknowledges
its arrival.</p>
<p>The SO_RCVSIZE option controls the maximum receive queue length.
This is a soft limit rather than a hard limit - RDS will
continue to accept and queue incoming messages, even if that
takes the queue length over the limit. However, it will also
mark the port as “congested” and send a congestion update to
the source node. The source node is supposed to throttle any
processes sending to this congested port.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bind(fd, &amp;sockaddr_in, …)</dt><dd><p>This binds the socket to a local IP address and port, and a
transport, if one has not already been selected via the
SO_RDS_TRANSPORT socket option</p>
</dd>
<dt>sendmsg(fd, …)</dt><dd><p>Sends a message to the indicated recipient. The kernel will
transparently establish the underlying reliable connection

<p>An attempt to send a message that exceeds SO_SNDSIZE will

<p>An attempt to send a message that would take the total number
of queued bytes over the SO_SNDSIZE threshold will return
EAGAIN.</p>
<p>An attempt to send a message to a destination that is marked
as “congested” will return ENOBUFS.</p>
</dd>
<dt>recvmsg(fd, …)</dt><dd><p>Receives a message that was queued to this socket. The sockets
recv queue accounting is adjusted, and if the queue length
drops below SO_SNDSIZE, the port is marked uncongested, and
a congestion update is sent to all peers.</p>
<p>Applications can ask the RDS kernel module to receive
notifications via control messages (for instance, there is a
notification when a congestion update arrived, or when a RDMA
operation completes). These notifications are received through
the msg.msg_control buffer of struct msghdr. The format of the
messages is described in manpages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>poll(fd)</dt><dd><p>RDS supports the poll interface to allow the application
to implement async I/O.</p>
<p>POLLIN handling is pretty straightforward. When there’s an
incoming message queued to the socket, or a pending notification,
we signal POLLIN.</p>
<p>POLLOUT is a little harder. Since you can essentially send
to any destination, RDS will always signal POLLOUT as long as
there’s room on the send queue (ie the number of bytes queued
is less than the sendbuf size).</p>
<p>However, the kernel will refuse to accept messages to
a destination marked congested - in this case you will loop
forever if you rely on poll to tell you what to do.
This isn’t a trivial problem, but applications can deal with
this - by using congestion notifications, and by checking for
ENOBUFS errors returned by sendmsg.</p>
</dd>
<dt>setsockopt(SOL_RDS, RDS_CANCEL_SENT_TO, &amp;sockaddr_in)</dt><dd><p>This allows the application to discard all messages queued to a
specific destination on this particular socket.</p>
<p>This allows the application to cancel outstanding messages if
it detects a timeout. For instance, if it tried to send a message,
and the remote host is unreachable, RDS will keep trying forever.
The application may decide it’s not worth it, and cancel the
operation. In this case, it would use RDS_CANCEL_SENT_TO to
nuke any pending messages.</p>

<p>ACK and retransmit handling</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>One might think that with reliable IB connections you wouldn’t need
to ack messages that have been received.  The problem is that IB
hardware generates an ack message before it has DMAed the message
into memory.  This creates a potential message loss if the HCA is
disabled for any reason between when it sends the ack and before
the message is DMAed and processed.  This is only a potential issue
if another HCA is available for fail-over.</p>
<p>Sending an ack immediately would allow the sender to free the sent
message from their send queue quickly, but could cause excessive
traffic to be used for acks. RDS piggybacks acks on sent data
packets.  Ack-only packets are reduced by only allowing one to be
in flight at a time, and by the sender only asking for acks when
its send buffers start to fill up. All retransmissions are also
acked.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Flow Control</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>RDS’s IB transport uses a credit-based mechanism to verify that
there is space in the peer’s receive buffers for more data. This
eliminates the need for hardware retries on the connection.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Congestion</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Messages waiting in the receive queue on the receiving socket
are accounted against the sockets SO_RCVBUF option value.  Only
the payload bytes in the message are accounted for.  If the
number of bytes queued equals or exceeds rcvbuf then the socket
is congested.  All sends attempted to this socket’s address
should return block or return -EWOULDBLOCK.</p>
<p>Applications are expected to be reasonably tuned such that this
situation very rarely occurs.  An application encountering this
“back-pressure” is considered a bug.</p>
<p>This is implemented by having each node maintain bitmaps which
indicate which ports on bound addresses are congested.  As the
bitmap changes it is sent through all the connections which
terminate in the local address of the bitmap which changed.</p>
<p>The bitmaps are allocated as connections are brought up.  This
avoids allocation in the interrupt handling path which queues
sages on sockets.  The dense bitmaps let transports send the
entire bitmap on any bitmap change reasonably efficiently.  This
is much easier to implement than some finer-grained
communication of per-port congestion.  The sender does a very
inexpensive bit test to test if the port it’s about to send to
is congested or not.</p>

<h2>Multipath RDS (mprds)<a class="headerlink" href="#multipath-rds-mprds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mprds is multipathed-RDS, primarily intended for RDS-over-TCP
(though the concept can be extended to other transports). The classical
implementation of RDS-over-TCP is implemented by demultiplexing multiple
PF_RDS sockets between any 2 endpoints (where endpoint == [IP address,
port]) over a single TCP socket between the 2 IP addresses involved. This
has the limitation that it ends up funneling multiple RDS flows over a
single TCP flow, thus it is
(a) upper-bounded to the single-flow bandwidth,
(b) suffers from head-of-line blocking for all the RDS sockets.</p>
<p>Better throughput (for a fixed small packet size, MTU) can be achieved
by having multiple TCP/IP flows per rds/tcp connection, i.e., multipathed
RDS (mprds).  Each such TCP/IP flow constitutes a path for the rds/tcp
connection. RDS sockets will be attached to a path based on some hash
(e.g., of local address and RDS port number) and packets for that RDS
socket will be sent over the attached path using TCP to segment/reassemble
RDS datagrams on that path.</p>
<p>Multipathed RDS is implemented by splitting the struct rds_connection into
a common (to all paths) part, and a per-path struct rds_conn_path. All
I/O workqs and reconnect threads are driven from the rds_conn_path.
Transports such as TCP that are multipath capable may then set up a
TCP socket per rds_conn_path, and this is managed by the transport via
the transport privatee cp_transport_data pointer.</p>
<p>Transports announce themselves as multipath capable by setting the
t_mp_capable bit during registration with the rds core module. When the
transport is multipath-capable, rds_sendmsg() hashes outgoing traffic
across multiple paths. The outgoing hash is computed based on the
local address and port that the PF_RDS socket is bound to.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if the transport is MP capable, we may be
peering with some node that does not support mprds, or supports
a different number of paths. As a result, the peering nodes need
to agree on the number of paths to be used for the connection.
This is done by sending out a control packet exchange before the
first data packet. The control packet exchange must have completed
prior to outgoing hash completion in rds_sendmsg() when the transport
is mutlipath capable.</p>
<p>The control packet is an RDS ping packet (i.e., packet to rds dest
port 0) with the ping packet having a rds extension header option  of
type RDS_EXTHDR_NPATHS, length 2 bytes, and the value is the
number of paths supported by the sender. The “probe” ping packet will
get sent from some reserved port, RDS_FLAG_PROBE_PORT (in &lt;linux/rds.h&gt;)
The receiver of a ping from RDS_FLAG_PROBE_PORT will thus immediately
be able to compute the min(sender_paths, rcvr_paths). The pong
sent in response to a probe-ping should contain the rcvr’s npaths
when the rcvr is mprds-capable.</p>
<p>If the rcvr is not mprds-capable, the exthdr in the ping will be
ignored.  In this case the pong will not have any exthdrs, so the sender
of the probe-ping can default to single-path mprds.</p>
