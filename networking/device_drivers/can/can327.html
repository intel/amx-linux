<p>This driver aims to lower the initial cost for hackers interested in
working with CAN buses.</p>
<p>CAN adapters are expensive, few, and far between.
ELM327 interfaces are cheap and plentiful.
Let’s use ELM327s as CAN adapters.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This driver is an effort to turn abundant ELM327 based OBD interfaces
into full fledged (as far as possible) CAN interfaces.</p>
<p>Since the ELM327 was never meant to be a stand alone CAN controller,
the driver has to switch between its modes as quickly as possible in
order to fake full-duplex operation.</p>
<p>As such, can327 is a best effort driver. However, this is more than
enough to implement simple request-response protocols (such as OBD II),
and to monitor broadcast messages on a bus (such as in a vehicle).</p>
<p>Most ELM327s come as nondescript serial devices, attached via USB or
Bluetooth. The driver cannot recognize them by itself, and as such it
is up to the user to attach it in form of a TTY line discipline
(similar to PPP, SLIP, slcan, …).</p>
<p>This driver is meant for ELM327 versions 1.4b and up, see below for
known limitations in older controllers and clones.</p>

<h2>How to attach the line discipline<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-attach-the-line-discipline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every ELM327 chip is factory programmed to operate at a serial setting
of 38400 baud/s, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stopbit.</p>
<p>If you have kept this default configuration, the line discipline can
be attached on a command prompt as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo ldattach \
       --debug \
       --speed 38400 \
       --eightbits \
       --noparity \
       --onestopbit \
       --iflag -ICRNL,INLCR,-IXOFF \
       30 \
       /dev/ttyUSB0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To change the ELM327’s serial settings, please refer to its data
sheet. This needs to be done before attaching the line discipline.</p>
<p>Once the ldisc is attached, the CAN interface starts out unconfigured.
Set the speed before starting it:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># The interface needs to be down to change parameters
sudo ip link set can0 down
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
sudo ip link set can0 up
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>500000 bit/s is a common rate for OBD-II diagnostics.
If you’re connecting straight to a car’s OBD port, this is the speed
that most cars (but not all!) expect.</p>
<p>After this, you can set out as usual with candump, cansniffer, etc.</p>

<h2>How to check the controller version<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-check-the-controller-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Use a terminal program to attach to the controller.</p>
<p>After issuing the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">WS</span></code>” command, the controller will respond with
its version:</p>

<section id="communication-example">
<h2>Communication example<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a short and incomplete introduction on how to talk to an ELM327.
It is here to guide understanding of the controller’s and the driver’s
limitation (listed below) as well as manual testing.</p>
<p>The ELM327 has two modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Command mode</p></li>
<li><p>Reception mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In command mode, it expects one command per line, terminated by CR.
By default, the prompt is a “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>”, after which a command can be
entered:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;ATE1
OK
&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The init script in the driver switches off several configuration options
that are only meaningful in the original OBD scenario the chip is meant
for, and are actually a hindrance for can327.</p>
<p>When a command is not recognized, such as by an older version of the
ELM327, a question mark is printed as a response instead of OK:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;ATUNKNOWN
?
&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At present, can327 does not evaluate this response. See the section
below on known limitations for details.</p>
<p>When a CAN frame is to be sent, the target address is configured, after
which the frame is sent as a command that consists of the data’s hex
dump:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;ATSH123
OK
&gt;DEADBEEF12345678
OK
&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above interaction sends the SFF frame “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DE</span> <span class="pre">AD</span> <span class="pre">BE</span> <span class="pre">EF</span> <span class="pre">12</span> <span class="pre">34</span> <span class="pre">56</span> <span class="pre">78</span></code>”
with (11 bit) CAN ID <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x123</span></code>.
For this to function, the controller must be configured for SFF sending
mode (using “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">PB</span></code>”, see code or datasheet).</p>
<p>Once a frame has been sent and wait-for-reply mode is on (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ATR1</span></code>,
configured on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">listen-only=off</span></code>), or when the reply timeout expires
and the driver sets the controller into monitoring mode (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ATMA</span></code>),
the ELM327 will send one line for each received CAN frame, consisting
of CAN ID, DLC, and data:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>123 8 DEADBEEF12345678
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For EFF (29 bit) CAN frames, the address format is slightly different,
which can327 uses to tell the two apart:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>12 34 56 78 8 DEADBEEF12345678
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ELM327 will receive both SFF and EFF frames - the current CAN
config (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ATPB</span></code>) does not matter.</p>
<p>If the ELM327’s internal UART sending buffer runs full, it will abort
the monitoring mode, print “BUFFER FULL” and drop back into command
mode. Note that in this case, unlike with other error messages, the
error message may appear on the same line as the last (usually
incomplete) data frame:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>12 34 56 78 8 DEADBEEF123 BUFFER FULL
</pre></div>
</div>

<section id="known-limitations-of-the-controller">
<h2>Known limitations of the controller<a class="headerlink" href="#known-limitations-of-the-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Clone devices (“v1.5” and others)</p>
<p>Sending RTR frames is not supported and will be dropped silently.</p>
<p>Receiving RTR with DLC 8 will appear to be a regular frame with
the last received frame’s DLC and payload.</p>
<p>“<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">CSM</span></code>” (CAN Silent Monitoring, i.e. don’t send CAN ACKs) is
not supported, and is hard coded to ON. Thus, frames are not ACKed
while listening: “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">MA</span></code>” (Monitor All) will always be “silent”.
However, immediately after sending a frame, the ELM327 will be in
“receive reply” mode, in which it <em>does</em> ACK any received frames.
Once the bus goes silent, or an error occurs (such as BUFFER FULL),
or the receive reply timeout runs out, the ELM327 will end reply
reception mode on its own and can327 will fall back to “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">MA</span></code>”
in order to keep monitoring the bus.</p>
<p>Other limitations may apply, depending on the clone and the quality
of its firmware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All versions</p>
<p>No full duplex operation is supported. The driver will switch
between input/output mode as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The length of outgoing RTR frames cannot be set. In fact, some
clones (tested with one identifying as “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v1.5</span></code>”) are unable to
send RTR frames at all.</p>
<p>We don’t have a way to get real-time notifications on CAN errors.
While there is a command (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">CS</span></code>) to retrieve some basic stats,
we don’t poll it as it would force us to interrupt reception mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Versions prior to 1.4b</p>
<p>These versions do not send CAN ACKs when in monitoring mode (AT MA).
However, they do send ACKs while waiting for a reply immediately
after sending a frame. The driver maximizes this time to make the
controller as useful as possible.</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.4b, the ELM327 supports the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">CSM</span></code>”
command, and the “listen-only” CAN option will take effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Versions prior to 1.4</p>
<p>These chips do not support the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">PB</span></code>” command, and thus cannot
change bitrate or SFF/EFF mode on-the-fly. This will have to be
programmed by the user before attaching the line discipline. See the
data sheet for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Versions prior to 1.3</p>
<p>These chips cannot be used at all with can327. They do not support
the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">D1</span></code>” command, which is necessary to avoid parsing conflicts
on incoming data, as well as distinction of RTR frame lengths.</p>
<p>Specifically, this allows for easy distinction of SFF and EFF
frames, and to check whether frames are complete. While it is possible
to deduce the type and length from the length of the line the ELM327
sends us, this method fails when the ELM327’s UART output buffer
overruns. It may abort sending in the middle of the line, which will
then be mistaken for something else.</p>

<section id="known-limitations-of-the-driver">
<h2>Known limitations of the driver<a class="headerlink" href="#known-limitations-of-the-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No 8/7 timing.</p>
<p>ELM327 can only set CAN bitrates that are of the form 500000/n, where
n is an integer divisor.
However there is an exception: With a separate flag, it may set the
speed to be 8/7 of the speed indicated by the divisor.
This mode is not currently implemented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No evaluation of command responses.</p>
<p>The ELM327 will reply with OK when a command is understood, and with ?
when it is not. The driver does not currently check this, and simply
assumes that the chip understands every command.
The driver is built such that functionality degrades gracefully
nevertheless. See the section on known limitations of the controller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No use of hardware CAN ID filtering</p>
<p>An ELM327’s UART sending buffer will easily overflow on heavy CAN bus
load, resulting in the “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUFFER</span> <span class="pre">FULL</span></code>” message. Using the hardware
filters available through “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">CF</span> <span class="pre">xxx</span></code>” and “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AT</span> <span class="pre">CM</span> <span class="pre">xxx</span></code>” would be
helpful here, however SocketCAN does not currently provide a facility
to make use of such hardware features.</p>

<h2>A note on CAN bus termination<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-on-can-bus-termination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your adapter may have resistors soldered in which are meant to terminate
the bus. This is correct when it is plugged into a OBD-II socket, but
not helpful when trying to tap into the middle of an existing CAN bus.</p>
<p>If communications don’t work with the adapter connected, check for the
termination resistors on its PCB and try removing them.</p>
