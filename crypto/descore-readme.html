<p>==&gt;&gt; To compile after untarring/unsharring, just <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> &lt;&lt;==</p>
<p>This package was designed with the following goals:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Highest possible encryption/decryption PERFORMANCE.</p></li>
<li><p>PORTABILITY to any byte-addressable host with a 32bit unsigned C type</p></li>
<li><p>Plug-compatible replacement for KERBEROS’s low-level routines.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This second release includes a number of performance enhancements for
register-starved machines.  My discussions with Richard Outerbridge,
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:71755&#46;204&#37;&#52;&#48;compuserve&#46;com">71755<span>&#46;</span>204<span>&#64;</span>compuserve<span>&#46;</span>com</a>, sparked a number of these enhancements.</p>
<p>To more rapidly understand the code in this package, inspect desSmallFips.i
(created by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code>) BEFORE you tackle desCode.h.  The latter is set
up in a parameterized fashion so it can easily be modified by speed-daemon
hackers in pursuit of that last microsecond.  You will find it more
illuminating to inspect one specific implementation,
and then move on to the common abstract skeleton with this one in mind.</p>
<p>performance comparison to other available des code which i could
compile on a SPARCStation 1 (cc -O4, gcc -O2):</p>
<p>this code (byte-order independent):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>30us per encryption (options: 64k tables, no IP/FP)</p></li>
<li><p>33us per encryption (options: 64k tables, FIPS standard bit ordering)</p></li>
<li><p>45us per encryption (options:  2k tables, no IP/FP)</p></li>
<li><p>48us per encryption (options:  2k tables, FIPS standard bit ordering)</p></li>
<li><p>275us to set a new key (uses 1k of key tables)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>this has the quickest encryption/decryption routines i’ve seen.
since i was interested in fast des filters rather than crypt(3)
and password cracking, i haven’t really bothered yet to speed up
the key setting routine. also, i have no interest in re-implementing
all the other junk in the mit kerberos des library, so i’ve just
provided my routines with little stub interfaces so they can be
used as drop-in replacements with mit’s code or any of the mit-
compatible packages below. (note that the first two timings above
are highly variable because of cache effects).</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>kerberos des replacement from australia (version 1.95):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>53us per encryption (uses 2k of tables)</p></li>
<li><p>96us to set a new key (uses 2.25k of key tables)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>so despite the author’s inclusion of some of the performance
improvements i had suggested to him, this package’s
encryption/decryption is still slower on the sparc and 68000.
more specifically, 19-40% slower on the 68020 and 11-35% slower
on the sparc,  depending on the compiler;

<h2>motivation and history<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-and-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>a while ago i wanted some des routines and the routines documented on sun’s
man pages either didn’t exist or dumped core.  i had heard of kerberos,
and knew that it used des,  so i figured i’d use its routines.  but once
i got it and looked at the code,  it really set off a lot of pet peeves -
it was too convoluted, the code had been written without taking
advantage of the regular structure of operations such as IP, E, and FP
(i.e. the author didn’t sit down and think before coding),
it was excessively slow,  the author had attempted to clarify the code
by adding MORE statements to make the data movement more <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">consistent</span></code>
instead of simplifying his implementation and cutting down on all data
movement (in particular, his use of L1, R1, L2, R2), and it was full of
idiotic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tweaks</span></code> for particular machines which failed to deliver significant
speedups but which did obfuscate everything.  so i took the test data
from his verification program and rewrote everything else.</p>
<p>a while later i ran across the great crypt(3) package mentioned above.
the fact that this guy was computing 2 sboxes per table lookup rather
than one (and using a MUCH larger table in the process) emboldened me to
do the same - it was a trivial change from which i had been scared away
by the larger table size.  in his case he didn’t realize you don’t need to keep
the working data in TWO forms, one for easy use of half the sboxes in
indexing, the other for easy use of the other half; instead you can keep
it in the form for the first half and use a simple rotate to get the other
half.  this means i have (almost) half the data manipulation and half
the table size.  in fairness though he might be encoding something particular
to crypt(3) in his tables - i didn’t check.</p>
<p>i’m glad that i implemented it the way i did, because this C version is
portable (the ifdef’s are performance enhancements) and it is faster
than versions hand-written in assembly for the sparc!</p>

<section id="porting-notes">
<h2>porting notes<a class="headerlink" href="#porting-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>one thing i did not want to do was write an enormous mess
which depended on endedness and other machine quirks,
and which necessarily produced different code and different lookup tables
for different machines.  see the kerberos code for an example
of what i didn’t want to do; all their endedness-specific <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">optimizations</span></code>
obfuscate the code and in the end were slower than a simpler machine
independent approach.  however, there are always some portability
considerations of some kind, and i have included some options
for varying numbers of register variables.
perhaps some will still regard the result as a mess!</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>i assume everything is byte addressable, although i don’t actually
depend on the byte order, and that bytes are 8 bits.
i assume word pointers can be freely cast to and from char pointers.
note that 99% of C programs make these assumptions.
i always use unsigned char’s if the high bit could be set.</p></li>
<li><p>the typedef <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word</span></code> means a 32 bit unsigned integral type.
if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unsigned</span> <span class="pre">long</span></code> is not 32 bits, change the typedef in desCore.h.
i assume sizeof(word) == 4 EVERYWHERE.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the (worst-case) cost of my NOT doing endedness-specific optimizations
in the data loading and storing code surrounding the key iterations
is less than 12%.  also, there is the added benefit that
the input and output work areas do not need to be word-aligned.</p>
</section>
<section id="optional-performance-optimizations">
<h2>OPTIONAL performance optimizations<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-performance-optimizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>you should define one of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i386,</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vax,</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mc68000,</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sparc,</span></code>
whichever one is closest to the capabilities of your machine.
see the start of desCode.h to see exactly what this selection implies.
note that if you select the wrong one, the des code will still work;
these are just performance tweaks.</p></li>
<li><p>for those with functional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asm</span></code> keywords: you should change the
ROR and ROL macros to use machine rotate instructions if you have them.
this will save 2 instructions and a temporary per use,
or about 32 to 40 instructions per en/decryption.</p>
<p>note that gcc is smart enough to translate the ROL/R macros into
machine rotates!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>these optimizations are all rather persnickety, yet with them you should
be able to get performance equal to assembly-coding, except that:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>with the lack of a bit rotate operator in C, rotates have to be synthesized
from shifts.  so access to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asm</span></code> will speed things up if your machine
has rotates, as explained above in (3) (not necessary if you use gcc).</p></li>
<li><p>if your machine has less than 12 32-bit registers i doubt your compiler will
generate good code.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i386</span></code> tries to configure the code for a 386 by only declaring 3 registers
(it appears that gcc can use ebx, esi and edi to hold register variables).
however, if you like assembly coding, the 386 does have 7 32-bit registers,
and if you use ALL of them, use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scaled</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">8</span></code> address modes with displacement
and other tricks, you can get reasonable routines for DesQuickCore… with
about 250 instructions apiece.  For DesSmall… it will help to rearrange
des_keymap, i.e., now the sbox # is the high part of the index and
the 6 bits of data is the low part; it helps to exchange these.</p>
<p>since i have no way to conveniently test it i have not provided my
shoehorned 386 version.  note that with this release of desCore, gcc is able
to put everything in registers(!), and generate about 370 instructions apiece
for the DesQuickCore… routines!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<section id="coding-notes">
<h2>coding notes<a class="headerlink" href="#coding-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the en/decryption routines each use 6 necessary register variables,
with 4 being actively used at once during the inner iterations.
if you don’t have 4 register variables get a new machine.
up to 8 more registers are used to hold constants in some configurations.</p>
<p>i assume that the use of a constant is more expensive than using a register:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>additionally, i have tried to put the larger constants in registers.
registering priority was by the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>anything more than 12 bits (bad for RISC and CISC)</p></li>
<li><p>greater than 127 in value (can’t use movq or byte immediate on CISC)</p></li>
<li><p>9-127 (may not be able to use CISC shift immediate or add/sub quick),</p></li>
<li><p>1-8 were never registered, being the cheapest constants.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>the compiler may be too stupid to realize table and table+256 should
be assigned to different constant registers and instead repetitively
do the arithmetic, so i assign these to explicit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">m</span></code> register variables
when possible and helpful.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>i assume that indexing is cheaper or equivalent to auto increment/decrement,
where the index is 7 bits unsigned or smaller.
this assumption is reversed for 68k and vax.</p>
<p>i assume that addresses can be cheaply formed from two registers,
or from a register and a small constant.
for the 68000, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">two</span> <span class="pre">registers</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">small</span> <span class="pre">offset</span></code> form is used sparingly.
all index scaling is done explicitly - no hidden shifts by log2(sizeof).</p>
<p>the code is written so that even a dumb compiler
should never need more than one hidden temporary,
increasing the chance that everything will fit in the registers.
KEEP THIS MORE SUBTLE POINT IN MIND IF YOU REWRITE ANYTHING.</p>
<p>(actually, there are some code fragments now which do require two temps,
but fixing it would either break the structure of the macros or
require declaring another temporary).</p>

<dt>DesMethod(m, k)</dt><dd><p>m points to a 128byte block, k points to an 8 byte des key
which must have odd parity (or -1 is returned) and which must

normally DesMethod() returns 0.</p>
<p>m is filled in from k so that when one of the routines below
is called with m, the routine will act like standard des
en/decryption with the key k. if you use DesMethod,
you supply a standard 56bit key; however, if you fill in
m yourself, you will get a 768bit key - but then it won’t
be standard.  it’s 768bits not 1024 because the least significant
two bits of each byte are not used.  note that these two bits
will be set to magic constants which speed up the encryption/decryption
on some machines.  and yes, each byte controls
a specific sbox during a specific iteration.</p>
<p>you really shouldn’t use the 768bit format directly;  i should
provide a routine that converts 128 6-bit bytes (specified in
S-box mapping order or something) into the right format for you.
this would entail some byte concatenation and rotation.</p>

<p>the Encrypt|Decrypt choice is obvious.</p>
<p>Fips|Core determines whether a completely standard FIPS initial

and stored in a nonstandard bit order (FIPS w/o IP/FP).</p>
<p>Fips slows down Quick by 10%, Small by 9%.</p>
<p>Small|Quick determines whether you use the normal routine
or the crazy quick one which gobbles up 64k more of memory.
Small is 50% slower then Quick, but Quick needs 32 times as much
memory.  Quick is included for programs that do nothing but DES,

<p>note that i have included a kerberos-compatible interface in desUtil.c
through the functions des_key_sched() and des_ecb_encrypt().
to use these with kerberos or kerberos-compatible code put desCore.a
ahead of the kerberos-compatible library on your linker’s command line.
you should not need to #include desCore.h;  just include the header
file provided with the kerberos library.</p>

<h2>Other uses<a class="headerlink" href="#other-uses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the macros in desCode.h would be very useful for putting inline des
functions in more complicated encryption routines.</p>
