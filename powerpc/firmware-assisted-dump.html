<h1>Firmware-Assisted Dump<a class="headerlink" href="#firmware-assisted-dump" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>July 2011</p>
<p>The goal of firmware-assisted dump is to enable the dump of
a crashed system, and to do so from a fully-reset system, and
to minimize the total elapsed time until the system is back
in production use.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Firmware-Assisted Dump (FADump) infrastructure is intended to replace
the existing phyp assisted dump.</p></li>
<li><p>Fadump uses the same firmware interfaces and memory reservation model
as phyp assisted dump.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike phyp dump, FADump exports the memory dump through /proc/vmcore
in the ELF format in the same way as kdump. This helps us reuse the
kdump infrastructure for dump capture and filtering.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike phyp dump, userspace tool does not need to refer any sysfs
interface while reading /proc/vmcore.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike phyp dump, FADump allows user to release all the memory reserved
for dump, with a single operation of echo 1 &gt; /sys/kernel/fadump_release_mem.</p></li>
<li><p>Once enabled through kernel boot parameter, FADump can be
started/stopped through /sys/kernel/fadump_registered interface (see
sysfs files section below) and can be easily integrated with kdump
service start/stop init scripts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing with kdump or other strategies, firmware-assisted
dump offers several strong, practical advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unlike kdump, the system has been reset, and loaded
with a fresh copy of the kernel.  In particular,
PCI and I/O devices have been reinitialized and are
in a clean, consistent state.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the dump is copied out, the memory that held the dump
is immediately available to the running kernel. And therefore,
unlike kdump, FADump doesn’t need a 2nd reboot to get back
the system to the production configuration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above can only be accomplished by coordination with,
and assistance from the Power firmware. The procedure is
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first kernel registers the sections of memory with the
Power firmware for dump preservation during OS initialization.
These registered sections of memory are reserved by the first
kernel during early boot.</p></li>
<li><p>When system crashes, the Power firmware will copy the registered
low memory regions (boot memory) from source to destination area.
It will also save hardware PTE’s.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>NOTE:</dt><dd><p>The term ‘boot memory’ means size of the low memory chunk
that is required for a kernel to boot successfully when
booted with restricted memory. By default, the boot memory
size will be the larger of 5% of system RAM or 256MB.
Alternatively, user can also specify boot memory size
through boot parameter ‘crashkernel=’ which will override
the default calculated size. Use this option if default
boot memory size is not sufficient for second kernel to
boot successfully. For syntax of crashkernel= parameter,
refer to <a class="reference internal" href="../admin-guide/kdump/kdump.html"><span class="doc">Documentation for Kdump - The kexec-based Crash Dumping Solution</span></a>. If any
offset is provided in crashkernel= parameter, it will be
ignored as FADump uses a predefined offset to reserve memory
for boot memory dump preservation in case of a crash.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p>After the low memory (boot memory) area has been saved, the
firmware will reset PCI and other hardware state.  It will
<em>not</em> clear the RAM. It will then launch the bootloader, as
normal.</p></li>
<li><p>The freshly booted kernel will notice that there is a new node
(rtas/ibm,kernel-dump on pSeries or ibm,opal/dump/mpipl-boot
on OPAL platform) in the device tree, indicating that
there is crash data available from a previous boot. During
the early boot OS will reserve rest of the memory above
boot memory size effectively booting with restricted memory
size. This will make sure that this kernel (also, referred
to as second kernel or capture kernel) will not touch any
of the dump memory area.</p></li>
<li><p>User-space tools will read /proc/vmcore to obtain the contents
of memory, which holds the previous crashed kernel dump in ELF
format. The userspace tools may copy this info to disk, or
network, nas, san, iscsi, etc. as desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the userspace tool is done saving dump, it will echo
‘1’ to /sys/kernel/fadump_release_mem to release the reserved
memory back to general use, except the memory required for
next firmware-assisted dump registration.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># echo 1 &gt; /sys/kernel/fadump_release_mem
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the firmware-assisted dump feature
is only available on POWER6 and above systems on pSeries
(PowerVM) platform and POWER9 and above systems with OP940
or later firmware versions on PowerNV (OPAL) platform.
Note that, OPAL firmware exports ibm,opal/dump node when
FADump is supported on PowerNV platform.</p>
<p>On OPAL based machines, system first boots into an intermittent
kernel (referred to as petitboot kernel) before booting into the
capture kernel. This kernel would have minimal kernel and/or
userspace support to process crash data. Such kernel needs to
preserve previously crash’ed kernel’s memory for the subsequent
capture kernel boot to process this crash data. Kernel config
option CONFIG_PRESERVE_FA_DUMP has to be enabled on such kernel
to ensure that crash data is preserved to process later.</p>
<dl>
<dt>– On OPAL based machines (PowerNV), if the kernel is build with</dt><dd><p>CONFIG_OPAL_CORE=y, OPAL memory at the time of crash is also
exported as /sys/firmware/opal/mpipl/core file. This procfs file is
helpful in debugging OPAL crashes with GDB. The kernel memory
used for exporting this procfs file can be released by echo’ing
‘1’ to /sys/firmware/opal/mpipl/release_core node.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>e.g.</dt><dd><p># echo 1 &gt; /sys/firmware/opal/mpipl/release_core</p>
</dd>

<h2>Implementation details:<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During boot, a check is made to see if firmware supports
this feature on that particular machine. If it does, then
we check to see if an active dump is waiting for us. If yes
then everything but boot memory size of RAM is reserved during
early boot (See Fig. 2). This area is released once we finish
collecting the dump from user land scripts (e.g. kdump scripts)
that are run. If there is dump data, then the
/sys/kernel/fadump_release_mem file is created, and the reserved
memory is held.</p>
<p>If there is no waiting dump data, then only the memory required to
hold CPU state, HPTE region, boot memory dump, FADump header and
elfcore header, is usually reserved at an offset greater than boot
memory size (see Fig. 1). This area is <em>not</em> released: this region
will be kept permanently reserved, so that it can act as a receptacle
for a copy of the boot memory content in addition to CPU state and
HPTE region, in the case a crash does occur.</p>
<p>Since this reserved memory area is used only after the system crash,
there is no point in blocking this significant chunk of memory from
production kernel. Hence, the implementation uses the Linux kernel’s
Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) for memory reservation if CMA is
configured for kernel. With CMA reservation this memory will be
available for applications to use it, while kernel is prevented from
using it. With this FADump will still be able to capture all of the
kernel memory and most of the user space memory except the user pages
that were present in CMA region:</p>

<p>Currently the dump will be copied from /proc/vmcore to a new file upon
user intervention. The dump data available through /proc/vmcore will be
in ELF format. Hence the existing kdump infrastructure (kdump scripts)
to save the dump works fine with minor modifications. KDump scripts on
major Distro releases have already been modified to work seamlessly (no
user intervention in saving the dump) when FADump is used, instead of
KDump, as dump mechanism.</p>
<p>The tools to examine the dump will be same as the ones
used for kdump.</p>

<li><p>The FADump implementation introduces a FADump crash info structure
in the scratch area before the ELF core header. The idea of introducing
this structure is to pass some important crash info data to the second
kernel which will help second kernel to populate ELF core header with
correct data before it gets exported through /proc/vmcore. The current
design implementation does not address a possibility of introducing
additional fields (in future) to this structure without affecting
compatibility. Need to come up with the better approach to address this.</p>
<p>The possible approaches are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Introduce version field for version tracking, bump up the version
whenever a new field is added to the structure in future. The version
field can be used to find out what fields are valid for the current
version of the structure.
2. Reserve the area of predefined size (say PAGE_SIZE) for this
structure and have unused area as reserved (initialized to zero)
for future field additions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The advantage of approach 1 over 2 is we don’t need to reserve extra space.</p>
