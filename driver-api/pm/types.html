<dt><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prepare</span></code></dt><dd><p>The principal role of this callback is to prevent new children of
the device from being registered after it has returned (the driver’s
subsystem and generally the rest of the kernel is supposed to prevent
new calls to the probe method from being made too once <strong>prepare()</strong> has
succeeded).  If <strong>prepare()</strong> detects a situation it cannot handle (e.g.
registration of a child already in progress), it may return -EAGAIN, so
that the PM core can execute it once again (e.g. after a new child has
been registered) to recover from the race condition.
This method is executed for all kinds of suspend transitions and is
followed by one of the suspend callbacks: <strong>suspend()</strong>, <strong>freeze()</strong>, or
<strong>poweroff()</strong>.  If the transition is a suspend to memory or standby (that
is, not related to hibernation), the return value of <strong>prepare()</strong> may be
used to indicate to the PM core to leave the device in runtime suspend
if applicable.  Namely, if <strong>prepare()</strong> returns a positive number, the PM
core will understand that as a declaration that the device appears to be
runtime-suspended and it may be left in that state during the entire
transition and during the subsequent resume if all of its descendants
are left in runtime suspend too.  If that happens, <strong>complete()</strong> will be
executed directly after <strong>prepare()</strong> and it must ensure the proper
functioning of the device after the system resume.
The PM core executes subsystem-level <strong>prepare()</strong> for all devices before
starting to invoke suspend callbacks for any of them, so generally
devices may be assumed to be functional or to respond to runtime resume
requests while <strong>prepare()</strong> is being executed.  However, device drivers
may NOT assume anything about the availability of user space at that
time and it is NOT valid to request firmware from within <strong>prepare()</strong>
(it’s too late to do that).  It also is NOT valid to allocate
substantial amounts of memory from <strong>prepare()</strong> in the GFP_KERNEL mode.
[To work around these limitations, drivers may register suspend and
hibernation notifiers to be executed before the freezing of tasks.]</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">complete</span></code></dt><dd><p>Undo the changes made by <strong>prepare()</strong>.  This method is executed for
all kinds of resume transitions, following one of the resume callbacks:
<strong>resume()</strong>, <strong>thaw()</strong>, <strong>restore()</strong>.  Also called if the state transition
fails before the driver’s suspend callback: <strong>suspend()</strong>, <strong>freeze()</strong> or
<strong>poweroff()</strong>, can be executed (e.g. if the suspend callback fails for one
of the other devices that the PM core has unsuccessfully attempted to
suspend earlier).
The PM core executes subsystem-level <strong>complete()</strong> after it has executed
the appropriate resume callbacks for all devices.  If the corresponding
<strong>prepare()</strong> at the beginning of the suspend transition returned a
positive number and the device was left in runtime suspend (without
executing any suspend and resume callbacks for it), <strong>complete()</strong> will be
the only callback executed for the device during resume.  In that case,
<strong>complete()</strong> must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure the
proper functioning of the device after the system resume.  To this end,
<strong>complete()</strong> can check the power.direct_complete flag of the device to
learn whether (unset) or not (set) the previous suspend and resume
callbacks have been executed for it.</p>

for a runtime resume to occur).  The state of the device at the time its
driver’s <strong>resume()</strong> callback is run depends on the platform and subsystem
the device belongs to.  On most platforms, there are no restrictions on

</div>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Several device power state transitions are externally visible, affecting
the state of pending I/O queues and (for drivers that touch hardware)
interrupts, wakeups, DMA, and other hardware state.  There may also be
internal transitions to various low-power modes which are transparent
to the rest of the driver stack (such as a driver that’s ON gating off
clocks which are not in active use).</p>
<p>The externally visible transitions are handled with the help of callbacks
included in this structure in such a way that, typically, two levels of
callbacks are involved.  First, the PM core executes callbacks provided by PM
domains, device types, classes and bus types.  They are the subsystem-level
callbacks expected to execute callbacks provided by device drivers, although
they may choose not to do that.  If the driver callbacks are executed, they
have to collaborate with the subsystem-level callbacks to achieve the goals
appropriate for the given system transition, given transition phase and the
subsystem the device belongs to.</p>
<p>All of the above callbacks, except for <strong>complete()</strong>, return error codes.
However, the error codes returned by <strong>resume()</strong>, <strong>thaw()</strong>, <strong>restore()</strong>,
<strong>resume_noirq()</strong>, <strong>thaw_noirq()</strong>, and <strong>restore_noirq()</strong>, do not cause the PM
core to abort the resume transition during which they are returned.  The
error codes returned in those cases are only printed to the system logs for
debugging purposes.  Still, it is recommended that drivers only return error
codes from their resume methods in case of an unrecoverable failure (i.e.
when the device being handled refuses to resume and becomes unusable) to
allow the PM core to be modified in the future, so that it can avoid
attempting to handle devices that failed to resume and their children.</p>
<p>It is allowed to unregister devices while the above callbacks are being
executed.  However, a callback routine MUST NOT try to unregister the device
it was called for, although it may unregister children of that device (for
example, if it detects that a child was unplugged while the system was
asleep).</p>
<p>There also are callbacks related to runtime power management of devices.
Again, as a rule these callbacks are executed by the PM core for subsystems
(PM domains, device types, classes and bus types) and the subsystem-level
callbacks are expected to invoke the driver callbacks.  Moreover, the exact
actions to be performed by a device driver’s callbacks generally depend on
the platform and subsystem the device belongs to.</p>
