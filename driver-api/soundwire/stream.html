<p>which is typically driven by a DMA(s) channel through the data link. An
audio stream contains one or more channels of data. All channels within
stream must have same sample rate and same sample size.</p>
<p>Assume a stream with two channels (Left &amp; Right) is opened using SoundWire
interface. Below are some ways a stream can be represented in SoundWire.</p>

Master. Both of the L and R channels are received by two different
Slaves. Master and both Slaves are using single port handling
L+R. Each Slave device processes the L + R data locally, typically
based on static configuration or dynamic orientation, and may drive
one or more speakers.</p>

<p>Note1: In multi-link cases like above, to lock, one would acquire a global
lock and then go on locking bus instances. But, in this case the caller
framework(ASoC DPCM) guarantees that stream operations on a card are
always serialized. So, there is no race condition and hence no need for
global lock.</p>
<p>Note2: A Slave device may be configured to receive all channels
transmitted on a link for a given Stream (Example 4) or just a subset
of the data (Example 3). The configuration of the Slave device is not
handled by a SoundWire subsystem API, but instead by the
snd_soc_dai_set_tdm_slot() API. The platform or machine driver will
typically configure which of the slots are used. For Example 4, the
same slots would be used by all Devices, while for Example 3 the Slave
Device1 would use e.g. Slot 0 and Slave device2 slot 1.</p>
<p>Note3: Multiple Sink ports can extract the same information for the
same bitSlots in the SoundWire frame, however multiple Source ports
shall be configured with different bitSlot configurations. This is the
same limitation as with I2S/PCM TDM usages.</p>

<h3>Stream State Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#stream-state-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Below section explains the operations done by the Bus on Master(s) and
Slave(s) as part of stream state transitions.</p>
<section id="sdw-stream-allocated">
<h4>SDW_STREAM_ALLOCATED<a class="headerlink" href="#sdw-stream-allocated" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Allocation state for stream. This is the entry state
of the stream. Operations performed before entering in this state:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A stream runtime is allocated for the stream. This stream
runtime is used as a reference for all the operations performed
on the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>The resources required for holding stream runtime information are
allocated and initialized. This holds all stream related information
such as stream type (PCM/PDM) and parameters, Master and Slave
interface associated with the stream, stream state etc.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After all above operations are successful, stream state is set to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SDW_STREAM_ALLOCATED</span></code>.</p>
<p>Bus implements below API for allocate a stream which needs to be called once
per stream. From ASoC DPCM framework, this stream state maybe linked to
.startup() operation.</p>

<p>The SoundWire core provides a sdw_startup_stream() helper function,
typically called during a dailink .startup() callback, which performs
stream allocation and sets the stream pointer for all DAIs
connected to a stream.</p>
