<p>This document is aimed at Linux kernel developers, and especially at
subsystem maintainers. It contains a subset of information discussed in
the more general “<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lfit/itpol/blob/master/protecting-code-integrity.md">Protecting Code Integrity</a>” guide published by the
Linux Foundation. Please read that document for more in-depth discussion
on some of the topics mentioned in this guide.</p>

<h2>The role of PGP in Linux Kernel development<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-pgp-in-linux-kernel-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PGP helps ensure the integrity of the code that is produced by the Linux
kernel development community and, to a lesser degree, establish trusted
communication channels between developers via PGP-signed email exchange.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel source code is available in two main formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Distributed source repositories (git)</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic release snapshots (tarballs)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both git repositories and tarballs carry PGP signatures of the kernel
developers who create official kernel releases. These signatures offer a
cryptographic guarantee that downloadable versions made available via
kernel.org or any other mirrors are identical to what these developers
have on their workstations. To this end:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>git repositories provide PGP signatures on all tags</p></li>
<li><p>tarballs provide detached PGP signatures with all downloads</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="trusting-the-developers-not-infrastructure">
<span id="devs-not-infra"></span><h3>Trusting the developers, not infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#trusting-the-developers-not-infrastructure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ever since the 2011 compromise of core kernel.org systems, the main
operating principle of the Kernel Archives project has been to assume
that any part of the infrastructure can be compromised at any time. For
this reason, the administrators have taken deliberate steps to emphasize
that trust must always be placed with developers and never with the code
hosting infrastructure, regardless of how good the security practices
for the latter may be.</p>
<p>The above guiding principle is the reason why this guide is needed. We
want to make sure that by placing trust into developers we do not simply
shift the blame for potential future security incidents to someone else.
The goal is to provide a set of guidelines developers can use to create
a secure working environment and safeguard the PGP keys used to
establish the integrity of the Linux kernel itself.</p>

<h3>Use GnuPG v2<a class="headerlink" href="#use-gnupg-v2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your distro should already have GnuPG installed by default, you just
need to verify that you are using version 2.x and not the legacy 1.4
release – many distributions still package both, with the default
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span></code> command invoking GnuPG v.1. To check, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --version | head -n1

</div>
<p>If you see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span> <span class="pre">(GnuPG)</span> <span class="pre">1.4.x</span></code>, then you are using GnuPG v.1. Try the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg2</span></code> command (if you don’t have it, you may need to install the
gnupg2 package):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg2 --version | head -n1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span> <span class="pre">(GnuPG)</span> <span class="pre">2.x.x</span></code>, then you are good to go. This guide
will assume you have the version 2.2 of GnuPG (or later). If you are
using version 2.0 of GnuPG, then some of the commands in this guide will
not work, and you should consider installing the latest 2.2 version of
GnuPG. Versions of gnupg-2.1.11 and later should be compatible for the
purposes of this guide as well.</p>
<p>If you have both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg2</span></code> commands, you should make sure you
are always using GnuPG v2, not the legacy version. You can enforce this
by setting the appropriate alias:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ alias gpg=gpg2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can put that in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.bashrc</span></code> to make sure it’s always the case.</p>
<section id="configure-gpg-agent-options">
<h4>Configure gpg-agent options<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-gpg-agent-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The GnuPG agent is a helper tool that will start automatically whenever
you use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span></code> command and run in the background with the purpose
of caching the private key passphrase. There are two options you should
know in order to tweak when the passphrase should be expired from cache:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">default-cache-ttl</span></code> (seconds): If you use the same key again before
the time-to-live expires, the countdown will reset for another period.
The default is 600 (10 minutes).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max-cache-ttl</span></code> (seconds): Regardless of how recently you’ve used
the key since initial passphrase entry, if the maximum time-to-live
countdown expires, you’ll have to enter the passphrase again. The
default is 30 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you find either of these defaults too short (or too long), you can
edit your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</span></code> file to set your own values:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># set to 30 minutes for regular ttl, and 2 hours for max ttl

<p>It is no longer necessary to start gpg-agent manually at the

it may not be doing the right thing any more.</p>

<p>This guide assumes that you already have a PGP key that you use for Linux
kernel development purposes. If you do not yet have one, please see the
“<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lfit/itpol/blob/master/protecting-code-integrity.md">Protecting Code Integrity</a>” document mentioned earlier for guidance
on how to create a new one.</p>
<p>You should also make a new key if your current one is weaker than 2048
bits (RSA).</p>
<section id="understanding-pgp-subkeys">
<h3>Understanding PGP Subkeys<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-pgp-subkeys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A PGP key rarely consists of a single keypair – usually it is a
collection of independent subkeys that can be used for different
purposes based on their capabilities, assigned at their creation time.
PGP defines four capabilities that a key can have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>[S]</strong> keys can be used for signing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[E]</strong> keys can be used for encryption</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[A]</strong> keys can be used for authentication</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[C]</strong> keys can be used for certifying other keys</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The key with the <strong>[C]</strong> capability is often called the “master” key,
but this terminology is misleading because it implies that the Certify
key can be used in place of any of other subkey on the same chain (like
a physical “master key” can be used to open the locks made for other
keys). Since this is not the case, this guide will refer to it as “the
Certify key” to avoid any ambiguity.</p>
<p>It is critical to fully understand the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All subkeys are fully independent from each other. If you lose a
private subkey, it cannot be restored or recreated from any other
private key on your chain.</p></li>
<li><p>With the exception of the Certify key, there can be multiple subkeys
with identical capabilities (e.g. you can have 2 valid encryption
subkeys, 3 valid signing subkeys, but only one valid certification
subkey). All subkeys are fully independent – a message encrypted to
one <strong>[E]</strong> subkey cannot be decrypted with any other <strong>[E]</strong> subkey
you may also have.</p></li>
<li><p>A single subkey may have multiple capabilities (e.g. your <strong>[C]</strong> key
can also be your <strong>[S]</strong> key).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The key carrying the <strong>[C]</strong> (certify) capability is the only key that
can be used to indicate relationship with other keys. Only the <strong>[C]</strong>
key can be used to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>add or revoke other keys (subkeys) with S/E/A capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>add, change or revoke identities (uids) associated with the key</p></li>
<li><p>add or change the expiration date on itself or any subkey</p></li>
<li><p>sign other people’s keys for web of trust purposes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, GnuPG creates the following when generating new keys:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One subkey carrying both Certify and Sign capabilities (<strong>[SC]</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>A separate subkey with the Encryption capability (<strong>[E]</strong>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you used the default parameters when generating your key, then that
is what you will have. You can verify by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg</span> <span class="pre">--list-secret-keys</span></code>,
for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sec   rsa2048 2018-01-23 [SC] [expires: 2020-01-23]
      000000000000000000000000AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD

ssb   rsa2048 2018-01-23 [E] [expires: 2020-01-23]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The long line under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code> entry is your key fingerprint –
whenever you see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[fpr]</span></code> in the examples below, that 40-character
string is what it refers to.</p>
</section>
<section id="ensure-your-passphrase-is-strong">
<h3>Ensure your passphrase is strong<a class="headerlink" href="#ensure-your-passphrase-is-strong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GnuPG uses passphrases to encrypt your private keys before storing them on
disk. This way, even if your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.gnupg</span></code> directory is leaked or stolen in
its entirety, the attackers cannot use your private keys without first
obtaining the passphrase to decrypt them.</p>
<p>It is absolutely essential that your private keys are protected by a
strong passphrase. To set it or change it, use:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --change-passphrase [fpr]

<section id="create-a-separate-signing-subkey">
<h3>Create a separate Signing subkey<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-separate-signing-subkey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our goal is to protect your Certify key by moving it to offline media,
so if you only have a combined <strong>[SC]</strong> key, then you should create a
separate signing subkey:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --quick-addkey [fpr] ed25519 sign

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>ECC support in GnuPG</p>
<p>GnuPG 2.1 and later has full support for Elliptic Curve
Cryptography, with ability to combine ECC subkeys with traditional
RSA keys. The main upside of ECC cryptography is that it is much
faster computationally and creates much smaller signatures when
compared byte for byte with 2048+ bit RSA keys. Unless you plan on
using a smartcard device that does not support ECC operations, we
recommend that you create an ECC signing subkey for your kernel
work.</p>
<p>Note, that if you plan to use a hardware device that does not
support ED25519 ECC keys, you should choose “nistp256” instead or
“ed25519.”</p>

<section id="back-up-your-certify-key-for-disaster-recovery">
<h3>Back up your Certify key for disaster recovery<a class="headerlink" href="#back-up-your-certify-key-for-disaster-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The more signatures you have on your PGP key from other developers, the
more reasons you have to create a backup version that lives on something
other than digital media, for disaster recovery reasons.</p>
<p>The best way to create a printable hardcopy of your private key is by
using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paperkey</span></code> software written for this very purpose. See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span>
<span class="pre">paperkey</span></code> for more details on the output format and its benefits over
other solutions. Paperkey should already be packaged for most
distributions.</p>
<p>Run the following command to create a hardcopy backup of your private
key:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --export-secret-key [fpr] | paperkey -o /tmp/key-backup.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Print out that file (or pipe the output straight to lpr), then take a
pen and write your passphrase on the margin of the paper. <strong>This is
strongly recommended</strong> because the key printout is still encrypted with
that passphrase, and if you ever change it you will not remember what it
used to be when you had created the backup – <em>guaranteed</em>.</p>
<p>Put the resulting printout and the hand-written passphrase into an envelope
and store in a secure and well-protected place, preferably away from your
home, such as your bank vault.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Your printer is probably no longer a simple dumb device connected to
your parallel port, but since the output is still encrypted with
your passphrase, printing out even to “cloud-integrated” modern
printers should remain a relatively safe operation.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="back-up-your-whole-gnupg-directory">
<h3>Back up your whole GnuPG directory<a class="headerlink" href="#back-up-your-whole-gnupg-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><strong>!!!Do not skip this step!!!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>It is important to have a readily available backup of your PGP keys
should you need to recover them. This is different from the
disaster-level preparedness we did with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paperkey</span></code>. You will also rely
on these external copies whenever you need to use your Certify key –
such as when making changes to your own key or signing other people’s
keys after conferences and summits.</p>
<p>Start by getting a small USB “thumb” drive (preferably two!) that you
will use for backup purposes. You will need to encrypt them using LUKS
– refer to your distro’s documentation on how to accomplish this.</p>
<p>For the encryption passphrase, you can use the same one as on your
PGP key.</p>
<p>Once the encryption process is over, re-insert the USB drive and make
sure it gets properly mounted. Copy your entire <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.gnupg</span></code> directory
over to the encrypted storage:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cp -a ~/.gnupg /media/disk/foo/gnupg-backup
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should now test to make sure everything still works:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --homedir=/media/disk/foo/gnupg-backup --list-key [fpr]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you don’t get any errors, then you should be good to go. Unmount the
USB drive, distinctly label it so you don’t blow it away next time you
need to use a random USB drive, and put in a safe place – but not too
far away, because you’ll need to use it every now and again for things
like editing identities, adding or revoking subkeys, or signing other
people’s keys.</p>

<section id="remove-the-certify-key-from-your-homedir">
<h3>Remove the Certify key from your homedir<a class="headerlink" href="#remove-the-certify-key-from-your-homedir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The files in our home directory are not as well protected as we like to
think.  They can be leaked or stolen via many different means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>by accident when making quick homedir copies to set up a new workstation</p></li>
<li><p>by systems administrator negligence or malice</p></li>
<li><p>via poorly secured backups</p></li>
<li><p>via malware in desktop apps (browsers, pdf viewers, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>via coercion when crossing international borders</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Protecting your key with a good passphrase greatly helps reduce the risk
of any of the above, but passphrases can be discovered via keyloggers,
shoulder-surfing, or any number of other means. For this reason, the
recommended setup is to remove your Certify key from your home directory
and store it on offline storage.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Please see the previous section and make sure you have backed up
your GnuPG directory in its entirety. What we are about to do will
render your key useless if you do not have a usable backup!</p>
</div>
<p>First, identify the keygrip of your Certify key:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --with-keygrip --list-key [fpr]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output will be something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pub   rsa2048 2018-01-24 [SC] [expires: 2020-01-24]

      Keygrip = 3333000000000000000000000000000000000000
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Find the keygrip entry that is beneath the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pub</span></code> line (right under the
Certify key fingerprint). This will correspond directly to a file in your
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.gnupg</span></code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cd ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d
$ ls
1111000000000000000000000000000000000000.key
2222000000000000000000000000000000000000.key
3333000000000000000000000000000000000000.key
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All you have to do is simply remove the .key file that corresponds to
the Certify key keygrip:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cd ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d
$ rm 1111000000000000000000000000000000000000.key
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, if you issue the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--list-secret-keys</span></code> command, it will show that
the Certify key is missing (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span></code> indicates it is not available):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --list-secret-keys

<p>You should also remove any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">secring.gpg</span></code> files in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.gnupg</span></code>

<p>Even though the Certify key is now safe from being leaked or stolen, the
subkeys are still in your home directory. Anyone who manages to get
their hands on those will be able to decrypt your communication or fake
your signatures (if they know the passphrase). Furthermore, each time a
GnuPG operation is performed, the keys are loaded into system memory and
can be stolen from there by sufficiently advanced malware (think
Meltdown and Spectre).</p>
<p>The best way to completely protect your keys is to move them to a
specialized hardware device that is capable of smartcard operations.</p>
<section id="the-benefits-of-smartcards">
<h3>The benefits of smartcards<a class="headerlink" href="#the-benefits-of-smartcards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A smartcard contains a cryptographic chip that is capable of storing
private keys and performing crypto operations directly on the card
itself. Because the key contents never leave the smartcard, the
operating system of the computer into which you plug in the hardware
device is not able to retrieve the private keys themselves. This is very
different from the encrypted USB storage device we used earlier for

<p>Unless all your laptops and workstations have smartcard readers, the

functionality. There are several options available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-start-6">Nitrokey Start</a>: Open hardware and Free Software, based on FSI
Japan’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsij.org/doc-gnuk/">Gnuk</a>. One of the few available commercial devices that
support ED25519 ECC keys, but offer fewest security features (such as
resistance to tampering or some side-channel attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nkpr2-nitrokey-pro-2-3">Nitrokey Pro 2</a>: Similar to the Nitrokey Start, but more
tamper-resistant and offers more security features. Pro 2 supports ECC
cryptography (NISTP).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/">Yubikey 5</a>: proprietary hardware and software, but cheaper than
Nitrokey Pro and comes available in the USB-C form that is more useful
with newer laptops. Offers additional security features such as FIDO
U2F, among others, and now finally supports NISTP and ED25519 ECC
keys.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/736231/">LWN has a good review</a> of some of the above models, as well as several

<h3>Configure your smartcard device<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-your-smartcard-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your smartcard device should Just Work (TM) the moment you plug it into
any modern Linux workstation. You can verify it by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --card-status
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you see full smartcard details, then you are good to go.
Unfortunately, troubleshooting all possible reasons why things may not
be working for you is way beyond the scope of this guide. If you are
having trouble getting the card to work with GnuPG, please seek help via
usual support channels.</p>
<p>To configure your smartcard, you will need to use the GnuPG menu system, as
there are no convenient command-line switches:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --card-edit
[...omitted...]
gpg/card&gt; admin
Admin commands are allowed
gpg/card&gt; passwd
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should set the user PIN (1), Admin PIN (3), and the Reset Code (4).
Please make sure to record and store these in a safe place – especially
the Admin PIN and the Reset Code (which allows you to completely wipe
the smartcard). You so rarely need to use the Admin PIN, that you will
inevitably forget what it is if you do not record it.</p>
<p>Getting back to the main card menu, you can also set other values (such
as name, sex, login data, etc), but it’s not necessary and will
additionally leak information about your smartcard should you lose it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Despite having the name “PIN”, neither the user PIN nor the admin

<p>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--edit-key</span></code> puts us into the menu mode again, and you will
notice that the key listing is a little different. From here on, all
commands are done from inside this menu mode, as indicated by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>First, let’s select the key we’ll be putting onto the card – you do
this by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> (it’s the first one in the listing, the <strong>[E]</strong>
subkey):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gpg&gt; key 1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the output, you should now see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ssb*</span></code> on the <strong>[E]</strong> key. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>
indicates which key is currently “selected.” It works as a <em>toggle</em>,
meaning that if you type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> again, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> will disappear and
the key will not be selected any more.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move that key onto the smartcard:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gpg&gt; keytocard
Please select where to store the key:
   (2) Encryption key
Your selection? 2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since it’s our <strong>[E]</strong> key, it makes sense to put it into the Encryption
slot.  When you submit your selection, you will be prompted first for
your PGP key passphrase, and then for the admin PIN. If the command
returns without an error, your key has been moved.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Now type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> again to unselect the first key, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> to select the <strong>[S]</strong> key:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gpg&gt; key 1
gpg&gt; key 2
gpg&gt; keytocard
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key
Your selection? 1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can use the <strong>[S]</strong> key both for Signature and Authentication, but
we want to make sure it’s in the Signature slot, so choose (1). Once
again, if your command returns without an error, then the operation was
successful:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gpg&gt; q
Save changes? (y/N) y
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Saving the changes will delete the keys you moved to the card from your
home directory (but it’s okay, because we have them in our backups
should we need to do this again for a replacement smartcard).</p>

<span id="pgp-with-git"></span><h2>Using PGP with Git<a class="headerlink" href="#using-pgp-with-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the core features of Git is its decentralized nature – once a
repository is cloned to your system, you have full history of the
project, including all of its tags, commits and branches. However, with
hundreds of cloned repositories floating around, how does anyone verify
that their copy of linux.git has not been tampered with by a malicious
third party?</p>
<p>Or what happens if a backdoor is discovered in the code and the “Author”
line in the commit says it was done by you, while you’re pretty sure you
had <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jayphelps/git-blame-someone-else">nothing to do with it</a>?</p>
<p>To address both of these issues, Git introduced PGP integration. Signed
tags prove the repository integrity by assuring that its contents are
exactly the same as on the workstation of the developer who created the
tag, while signed commits make it nearly impossible for someone to
impersonate you without having access to your PGP keys.</p>

<h3>Configure git to use your PGP key<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-git-to-use-your-pgp-key" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you only have one secret key in your keyring, then you don’t really
need to do anything extra, as it becomes your default key.  However, if

<h3>How to work with signed commits<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-work-with-signed-commits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to create signed commits, but it is much more difficult to
use them in Linux kernel development, since it relies on patches sent to
the mailing list, and this workflow does not preserve PGP commit
signatures. Furthermore, when rebasing your repository to match
upstream, even your own PGP commit signatures will end up discarded. For
this reason, most kernel developers don’t bother signing their commits
and will ignore signed commits in any external repositories that they
rely upon in their work.</p>
<p>However, if you have your working git tree publicly available at some
git hosting service (kernel.org, infradead.org, ozlabs.org, or others),
then the recommendation is that you sign all your git commits even if
upstream developers do not directly benefit from this practice.</p>
<p>We recommend this for the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Should there ever be a need to perform code forensics or track code
provenance, even externally maintained trees carrying PGP commit
signatures will be valuable for such purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>If you ever need to re-clone your local repository (for example,
after a disk failure), this lets you easily verify the repository
integrity before resuming your work.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone needs to cherry-pick your commits, this allows them to
quickly verify their integrity before applying them.</p></li>

<p>DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (“DANE”) is a method for
publishing public keys in DNS and securing them using DNSSEC signed
zones. Web Key Directory (“WKD”) is the alternative method that uses
https lookups for the same purpose. When using either DANE or WKD for
looking up public keys, GnuPG will validate DNSSEC or TLS certificates,
respectively, before adding auto-retrieved public keys to your local
keyring.</p>
<p>Kernel.org publishes the WKD for all developers who have kernel.org
accounts. Once you have the above changes in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpg.conf</span></code>, you can
auto-retrieve the keys for Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman (if you
don’t already have them):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gpg --locate-keys torvalds@kernel.org gregkh@kernel.org
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a kernel.org account, then you should <a class="reference external" href="https://korg.wiki.kernel.org/userdoc/mail#adding_a_kernelorg_uid_to_your_pgp_key">add the kernel.org
UID to your key</a> to make WKD more useful to other kernel developers.</p>

<h3>Web of Trust (WOT) vs. Trust on First Use (TOFU)<a class="headerlink" href="#web-of-trust-wot-vs-trust-on-first-use-tofu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PGP incorporates a trust delegation mechanism known as the “Web of
Trust.” At its core, this is an attempt to replace the need for
centralized Certification Authorities of the HTTPS/TLS world. Instead of
various software makers dictating who should be your trusted certifying
entity, PGP leaves this responsibility to each user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very few people understand how the Web of Trust works.
While it remains an important aspect of the OpenPGP specification,
recent versions of GnuPG (2.2 and above) have implemented an alternative
mechanism called “Trust on First Use” (TOFU). You can think of TOFU as
“the SSH-like approach to trust.” With SSH, the first time you connect
to a remote system, its key fingerprint is recorded and remembered. If
the key changes in the future, the SSH client will alert you and refuse
to connect, forcing you to make a decision on whether you choose to
trust the changed key or not. Similarly, the first time you import
someone’s PGP key, it is assumed to be valid. If at any point in the
future GnuPG comes across another key with the same identity, both the
previously imported key and the new key will be marked as invalid and
you will need to manually figure out which one to keep.</p>
<p>We recommend that you use the combined TOFU+PGP trust model (which is
the new default in GnuPG v2). To set it, add (or modify) the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trust-model</span></code> setting in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</span></code>:</p>

<h3>Using the kernel.org web of trust repository<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-kernel-org-web-of-trust-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kernel.org maintains a git repository with developers’ public keys as a
replacement for replicating keyserver networks that have gone mostly
dark in the past few years. The full documentation for how to set up
that repository as your source of public keys can be found here:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you are a kernel developer, please consider submitting your key for
inclusion into that keyring.</p>
