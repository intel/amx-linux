<p>Charger Manager provides in-kernel battery charger management that
requires temperature monitoring during suspend-to-RAM state
and where each battery may have multiple chargers attached and the userland
wants to look at the aggregated information of the multiple chargers.</p>
<p>Charger Manager is a platform_driver with power-supply-class entries.
An instance of Charger Manager (a platform-device created with Charger-Manager)
represents an independent battery with chargers. If there are multiple
batteries with their own chargers acting independently in a system,
the system may need multiple instances of Charger Manager.</p>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Charger Manager supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Support for multiple chargers (e.g., a device with USB, AC, and solar panels)</dt><dd><p>A system may have multiple chargers (or power sources) and some of
they may be activated at the same time. Each charger may have its
own power-supply-class and each power-supply-class can provide
different information about the battery status. This framework
aggregates charger-related information from multiple sources and
shows combined information as a single power-supply-class.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Support for in suspend-to-RAM polling (with suspend_again callback)</dt><dd><p>While the battery is being charged and the system is in suspend-to-RAM,
we may need to monitor the battery health by looking at the ambient or
battery temperature. We can accomplish this by waking up the system
periodically. However, such a method wakes up devices unnecessarily for
monitoring the battery health and tasks, and user processes that are
supposed to be kept suspended. That, in turn, incurs unnecessary power
consumption and slow down charging process. Or even, such peak power
consumption can stop chargers in the middle of charging
(external power input &lt; device power consumption), which not
only affects the charging time, but the lifespan of the battery.</p>
<p>Charger Manager provides a function “cm_suspend_again” that can be
used as suspend_again callback of platform_suspend_ops. If the platform
requires tasks other than cm_suspend_again, it may implement its own
suspend_again callback that calls cm_suspend_again in the middle.
Normally, the platform will need to resume and suspend some devices
that are used by Charger Manager.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Support for premature full-battery event handling</dt><dd><p>If the battery voltage drops by “fullbatt_vchkdrop_uV” after
“fullbatt_vchkdrop_ms” from the full-battery event, the framework
restarts charging. This check is also performed while suspended by
setting wakeup time accordingly and using suspend_again.</p>

<h2>2. Global Charger-Manager Data related with suspend_again<a class="headerlink" href="#global-charger-manager-data-related-with-suspend-again" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to setup Charger Manager with suspend-again feature
(in-suspend monitoring), the user should provide charger_global_desc
with setup_charger_manager(<cite>struct charger_global_desc *</cite>).
This charger_global_desc data for in-suspend monitoring is global
as the name suggests. Thus, the user needs to provide only once even
if there are multiple batteries. If there are multiple batteries, the
multiple instances of Charger Manager share the same charger_global_desc
and it will manage in-suspend monitoring for all instances of Charger Manager.</p>
<p>The user needs to provide all the three entries to <cite>struct charger_global_desc</cite>
properly in order to activate in-suspend monitoring:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><cite>char *rtc_name;</cite></dt><dd><p>The name of rtc (e.g., “rtc0”) used to wakeup the system from
suspend for Charger Manager. The alarm interrupt (AIE) of the rtc
should be able to wake up the system from suspend. Charger Manager
saves and restores the alarm value and use the previously-defined
alarm if it is going to go off earlier than Charger Manager so that
Charger Manager does not interfere with previously-defined alarms.</p>
</dd>
<dt><cite>bool (*rtc_only_wakeup)(void);</cite></dt><dd><p>This callback should let CM know whether
the wakeup-from-suspend is caused only by the alarm of “rtc” in the
same struct. If there is any other wakeup source triggered the
wakeup, it should return false. If the “rtc” is the only wakeup
reason, it should return true.</p>
</dd>
<dt><cite>bool assume_timer_stops_in_suspend;</cite></dt><dd><p>if true, Charger Manager assumes that
the timer (CM uses jiffies as timer) stops during suspend. Then, CM
assumes that the suspend-duration is same as the alarm length.</p>

</dl>

<section id="how-to-setup-suspend-again">
<h2>3. How to setup suspend_again<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-setup-suspend-again" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Charger Manager provides a function “extern bool cm_suspend_again(void)”.
When cm_suspend_again is called, it monitors every battery. The suspend_ops
callback of the system’s platform_suspend_ops can call cm_suspend_again
function to know whether Charger Manager wants to suspend again or not.
If there are no other devices or tasks that want to use suspend_again
feature, the platform_suspend_ops may directly refer to cm_suspend_again
for its suspend_again callback.</p>
<p>The cm_suspend_again() returns true (meaning “I want to suspend again”)
if the system was woken up by Charger Manager and the polling
(in-suspend monitoring) results in “normal”.</p>

<h2>5. Notify Charger-Manager of charger events: cm_notify_event()<a class="headerlink" href="#notify-charger-manager-of-charger-events-cm-notify-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If there is an charger event is required to notify
Charger Manager, a charger device driver that triggers the event can call
cm_notify_event(psy, type, msg) to notify the corresponding Charger Manager.
In the function, psy is the charger driver’s power_supply pointer, which is
associated with Charger-Manager. The parameter “type”
is the same as irq’s type (enum cm_event_types). The event message “msg” is
optional and is effective only if the event type is “UNDESCRIBED” or “OTHERS”.</p>

<section id="other-considerations">
<h2>6. Other Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#other-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the charger/battery-related events such as battery-pulled-out,
charger-pulled-out, charger-inserted, DCIN-over/under-voltage, charger-stopped,
and others critical to chargers, the system should be configured to wake up.
At least the following should wake up the system from a suspend:
a) charger-on/off b) external-power-in/out c) battery-in/out (while charging)</p>
<p>It is usually accomplished by configuring the PMIC as a wakeup source.</p>
