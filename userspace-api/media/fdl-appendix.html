<section id="preamble">
<span id="fdl-preamble"></span><h2>0. PREAMBLE<a class="headerlink" href="#preamble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying
it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
others.</p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
</section>
<section id="applicability-and-definitions">
<span id="fdl-section1"></span><h2>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<a class="headerlink" href="#applicability-and-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="fdl-document">This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
terms of this License. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual
or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
“you”.</p>
<p id="fdl-modified">A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p id="fdl-secondary">A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> that deals exclusively with the
relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if
the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section
may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</p>
<p id="fdl-invariant">The “Invariant Sections” are certain
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-secondary"><span class="std std-ref">Secondary Sections</span></a> whose titles are designated,
as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> is released under this License.</p>
<p id="fdl-cover-texts">The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> is released under this License.</p>
<p id="fdl-transparent">A “Transparent” copy of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited
directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some
word processors for output purposes only.</p>
<p id="fdl-title-page">The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the
most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning
of the body of the text.</p>
</section>
<section id="verbatim-copying">
<span id="fdl-section2"></span><h2>2. VERBATIM COPYING<a class="headerlink" href="#verbatim-copying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may copy and distribute the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may
not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-section3"><span class="std std-ref">section 3</span></a>.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.</p>
</section>
<section id="copying-in-quantity">
<span id="fdl-section3"></span><h2>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<a class="headerlink" href="#copying-in-quantity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you publish printed copies of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>
numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-cover-texts"><span class="std std-ref">Cover Texts</span></a>, you must enclose the copies in
covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> and satisfy these conditions, can be
treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-transparent"><span class="std std-ref">Opaque</span></a> copies of
the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> numbering more than 100, you must
either include a machine-readable <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-transparent"><span class="std std-ref">Transparent</span></a>
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> well before redistributing any large
number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
version of the Document.</p>
</section>
<section id="modifications">
<span id="fdl-section4"></span><h2>4. MODIFICATIONS<a class="headerlink" href="#modifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may copy and distribute a <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>
of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> under the conditions of sections
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-section2"><span class="std std-ref">2</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-section3"><span class="std std-ref">3</span></a> above, provided
that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
Modified Version:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>A.</strong>
Use in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-title-page"><span class="std std-ref">Title Page</span></a> (and on the covers,
if any) a title distinct from that of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of
the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if
the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B.</strong>
List on the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-title-page"><span class="std std-ref">Title Page</span></a>, as authors, one or
more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the
modifications in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> (all of its principal authors, if it
has less than five).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>C.</strong>
State on the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-title-page"><span class="std std-ref">Title Page</span></a> the name of the
publisher of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>, as the
publisher.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>D.</strong>
Preserve all the copyright notices of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>E.</strong>
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
to the other copyright notices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>F.</strong>
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a> under the terms of this
License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>G.</strong>
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-invariant"><span class="std std-ref">Invariant Sections</span></a> and required
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-cover-texts"><span class="std std-ref">Cover Texts</span></a> given in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document’s</span></a> license notice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>H.</strong>
Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I.</strong>
Preserve the section entitled “History”, and its title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a> as given on the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-title-page"><span class="std std-ref">Title Page</span></a>. If there is no section entitled
“History” in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>, create one stating
the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on
its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
stated in the previous sentence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>J.</strong>
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> for public access to a
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-transparent"><span class="std std-ref">Transparent</span></a> copy of the Document, and
likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History”
section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>K.</strong>
In any section entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, preserve
the section’s title, and preserve in the section all the substance
and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>L.</strong>
Preserve all the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-invariant"><span class="std std-ref">Invariant Sections</span></a> of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>, unaltered in their text and in
their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
part of the section titles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>M.</strong>
Delete any section entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be
included in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>N.</strong>
Do not retitle any existing section as “Endorsements” or to conflict
in title with any <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-invariant"><span class="std std-ref">Invariant Section</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a> includes new
front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-secondary"><span class="std std-ref">Secondary Sections</span></a> and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
of <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-invariant"><span class="std std-ref">Invariant Sections</span></a> in the Modified Version’s
license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a> by various parties–for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-cover-texts"><span class="std std-ref">Front-Cover Text</span></a>, and a passage of up to 25
words as a <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-cover-texts"><span class="std std-ref">Back-Cover Text</span></a>, to the end of the
list of <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-cover-texts"><span class="std std-ref">Cover Texts</span></a> in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity. If the
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> already includes a cover text for the
same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a>
do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity
for or to assert or imply endorsement of any
<a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-modified"><span class="std std-ref">Modified Version</span></a>.</p>

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-invariant"><span class="std std-ref">Invariant Sections</span></a> may be
replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections
with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of
the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the
list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled “History” in
the various original documents, forming one section entitled “History”;
likewise combine any sections entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any
sections entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections entitled
“Endorsements.”</p>

<p>A compilation of the <a class="reference internal" href="#fdl-document"><span class="std std-ref">Document</span></a> or its derivatives

compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation
is called an “aggregate”, and this License does not apply to the other
self-contained works thus compiled with the Document , on account of
their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works
