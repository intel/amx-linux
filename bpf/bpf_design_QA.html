<h1>BPF Design Q&amp;A<a class="headerlink" href="#bpf-design-q-a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>BPF extensibility and applicability to networking, tracing, security
in the linux kernel and several user space implementations of BPF
virtual machine led to a number of misunderstanding on what BPF actually is.
This short QA is an attempt to address that and outline a direction
of where BPF is heading long term.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Q: Why C calling convention was chosen?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-why-c-calling-convention-was-chosen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A: Because BPF programs are designed to run in the linux kernel
which is written in C, hence BPF defines instruction set compatible
with two most used architectures x64 and arm64 (and takes into
consideration important quirks of other architectures) and
defines calling convention that is compatible with C calling
convention of the linux kernel on those architectures.</p>

<p>A: NO. BPF calling convention only allows registers R1-R5 to be used
as arguments. BPF is not a standalone instruction set.
(unlike x64 ISA that allows msft, cdecl and other conventions)</p>

<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>Only frame pointer (register R10) is accessible.
From compiler point of view it’s necessary to have stack pointer.
For example, LLVM defines register R11 as stack pointer in its
BPF backend, but it makes sure that generated code never uses it.</p>

<p>A: YES.</p>
<p>BPF design forces addition of major functionality in the form
of kernel helper functions and kernel objects like BPF maps with
seamless interoperability between them. It lets kernel call into
BPF programs and programs call kernel helpers with zero overhead,
as all of them were native C code. That is particularly the case
for JITed BPF programs that are indistinguishable from
native kernel C code.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Q: What are the verifier limits?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-what-are-the-verifier-limits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A: The only limit known to the user space is BPF_MAXINSNS (4096).
It’s the maximum number of instructions that the unprivileged bpf
program can have. The verifier has various internal limits.
Like the maximum number of instructions that can be explored during
program analysis. Currently, that limit is set to 1 million.
Which essentially means that the largest program can consist
of 1 million NOP instructions. There is a limit to the maximum number
of subsequent branches, a limit to the number of nested bpf-to-bpf
calls, a limit to the number of the verifier states per instruction,
a limit to the number of maps used by the program.
All these limits can be hit with a sufficiently complex program.
There are also non-numerical limits that can cause the program
to be rejected. The verifier used to recognize only pointer + constant
expressions. Now it can recognize pointer + bounded_register.
bpf_lookup_map_elem(key) had a requirement that ‘key’ must be
a pointer to the stack. Now, ‘key’ can be a pointer to map value.
The verifier is steadily getting ‘smarter’. The limits are
being removed. The only way to know that the program is going to
be accepted by the verifier is to try to load it.
The bpf development process guarantees that the future kernel
versions will accept all bpf programs that were accepted by
the earlier versions.</p>

<p>Q: How come LD_ABS and LD_IND instruction are present in BPF whereas
C code cannot express them and has to use builtin intrinsics?</p>
<p>A: This is artifact of compatibility with classic BPF. Modern
networking code in BPF performs better without them.

<p>Q: It seems not all BPF instructions are one-to-one to native CPU.
For example why BPF_JNE and other compare and jumps are not cpu-like?</p>
<p>A: This was necessary to avoid introducing flags into ISA which are

<p>A: Because if we picked one-to-one relationship to x64 it would have made

<p>A: Because architectures like sparc have register windows and in general
there are enough subtle differences between architectures, so naive
store return address into stack won’t work. Another reason is BPF has
to be safe from division by zero (and legacy exception path
of LD_ABS insn). Those instructions need to invoke epilogue and
return implicitly.</p>

<p>A: Because classic BPF didn’t have them and BPF authors felt that compiler
workaround would be acceptable. Turned out that programs lose performance
due to lack of these compare instructions and they were added.
These two instructions is a perfect example what kind of new BPF
instructions are acceptable and can be added in the future.
These two already had equivalent instructions in native CPUs.
New instructions that don’t have one-to-one mapping to HW instructions
will not be accepted.</p>

<section id="q-bpf-32-bit-subregister-requirements">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Q: BPF 32-bit subregister requirements</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-bpf-32-bit-subregister-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Q: BPF 32-bit subregisters have a requirement to zero upper 32-bits of BPF
registers which makes BPF inefficient virtual machine for 32-bit
CPU architectures and 32-bit HW accelerators. Can true 32-bit registers
be added to BPF in the future?</p>
<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>But some optimizations on zero-ing the upper 32 bits for BPF registers are
available, and can be leveraged to improve the performance of JITed BPF
programs for 32-bit architectures.</p>
<p>Starting with version 7, LLVM is able to generate instructions that operate
on 32-bit subregisters, provided the option -mattr=+alu32 is passed for
compiling a program. Furthermore, the verifier can now mark the
instructions for which zero-ing the upper bits of the destination register
is required, and insert an explicit zero-extension (zext) instruction
(a mov32 variant). This means that for architectures without zext hardware
support, the JIT back-ends do not need to clear the upper bits for
subregisters written by alu32 instructions or narrow loads. Instead, the
back-ends simply need to support code generation for that mov32 variant,
and to overwrite bpf_jit_needs_zext() to make it return “true” (in order to
enable zext insertion in the verifier).</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for a JIT back-end to have partial hardware
support for zext. In that case, if verifier zext insertion is enabled,
it could lead to the insertion of unnecessary zext instructions. Such
instructions could be removed by creating a simple peephole inside the JIT
back-end: if one instruction has hardware support for zext and if the next
instruction is an explicit zext, then the latter can be skipped when doing
the code generation.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Q: Does BPF have a stable ABI?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-does-bpf-have-a-stable-abi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A: YES. BPF instructions, arguments to BPF programs, set of helper
functions and their arguments, recognized return codes are all part
of ABI. However there is one specific exception to tracing programs
which are using helpers like bpf_probe_read() to walk kernel internal
data structures and compile with kernel internal headers. Both of these
kernel internals are subject to change and can break with newer kernels
such that the program needs to be adapted accordingly.</p>

<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>Tracing bpf programs can <em>read</em> arbitrary memory with bpf_probe_read()
and bpf_probe_read_str() helpers. Networking programs cannot read
arbitrary memory, since they don’t have access to these helpers.
Programs can never read or write arbitrary memory directly.</p>

<p>A: Sort-of.</p>
<p>Tracing BPF programs can overwrite the user memory
of the current task with bpf_probe_write_user(). Every time such
program is loaded the kernel will print warning message, so
this helper is only useful for experiments and prototypes.

<p>Q: Some kernel functions (e.g. tcp_slow_start) can be called
by BPF programs.  Do these kernel functions become an ABI?</p>
<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>The kernel function protos will change and the bpf programs will be
rejected by the verifier.  Also, for example, some of the bpf-callable
kernel functions have already been used by other kernel tcp
cc (congestion-control) implementations.  If any of these kernel
functions has changed, both the in-tree and out-of-tree kernel tcp cc
implementations have to be changed.  The same goes for the bpf
programs and they have to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Q: BPF programs can be attached to many kernel functions.  Do these
kernel functions become part of the ABI?</p>
<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>The kernel function prototypes will change, and BPF programs attaching to
them will need to change.  The BPF compile-once-run-everywhere (CO-RE)
should be used in order to make it easier to adapt your BPF programs to
different versions of the kernel.</p>

<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>The BTF_ID macro does not cause a function to become part of the ABI
any more than does the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id35">Q: What is the compatibility story for special BPF types in map values?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-what-is-the-compatibility-story-for-special-bpf-types-in-map-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Q: Users are allowed to embed bpf_spin_lock, bpf_timer fields in their BPF map
values (when using BTF support for BPF maps). This allows to use helpers for
such objects on these fields inside map values. Users are also allowed to embed
pointers to some kernel types (with __kptr and __kptr_ref BTF tags). Will the
kernel preserve backwards compatibility for these features?</p>
<p>A: It depends. For bpf_spin_lock, bpf_timer: YES, for kptr and everything else:
NO, but see below.</p>
<p>For struct types that have been added already, like bpf_spin_lock and bpf_timer,
the kernel will preserve backwards compatibility, as they are part of UAPI.</p>
<p>For kptrs, they are also part of UAPI, but only with respect to the kptr
mechanism. The types that you can use with a __kptr and __kptr_ref tagged
pointer in your struct are NOT part of the UAPI contract. The supported types can
and will change across kernel releases. However, operations like accessing kptr
fields and bpf_kptr_xchg() helper will continue to be supported across kernel
releases for the supported types.</p>
<p>For any other supported struct type, unless explicitly stated in this document
and added to bpf.h UAPI header, such types can and will arbitrarily change their
size, type, and alignment, or any other user visible API or ABI detail across
kernel releases. The users must adapt their BPF programs to the new changes and
update them to make sure their programs continue to work correctly.</p>
<p>NOTE: BPF subsystem specially reserves the ‘bpf_’ prefix for type names, in
order to introduce more special fields in the future. Hence, user programs must
avoid defining types with ‘bpf_’ prefix to not be broken in future releases.
In other words, no backwards compatibility is guaranteed if one using a type
in BTF with ‘bpf_’ prefix.</p>

<section id="q-what-is-the-compatibility-story-for-special-bpf-types-in-allocated-objects">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">Q: What is the compatibility story for special BPF types in allocated objects?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#q-what-is-the-compatibility-story-for-special-bpf-types-in-allocated-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Q: Same as above, but for allocated objects (i.e. objects allocated using
bpf_obj_new for user defined types). Will the kernel preserve backwards
compatibility for these features?</p>
<p>A: NO.</p>
<p>Unlike map value types, there are no stability guarantees for this case. The
whole API to work with allocated objects and any support for special fields
inside them is unstable (since it is exposed through kfuncs).</p>
