<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hardware spinlock modules provide hardware assistance for synchronization
and mutual exclusion between heterogeneous processors and those not operating
under a single, shared operating system.</p>
<p>For example, OMAP4 has dual Cortex-A9, dual Cortex-M3 and a C64x+ DSP,
each of which is running a different Operating System (the master, A9,
is usually running Linux and the slave processors, the M3 and the DSP,
are running some flavor of RTOS).</p>
<p>A generic hwspinlock framework allows platform-independent drivers to use
the hwspinlock device in order to access data structures that are shared
between remote processors, that otherwise have no alternative mechanism
to accomplish synchronization and mutual exclusion operations.</p>
<p>This is necessary, for example, for Inter-processor communications:
on OMAP4, cpu-intensive multimedia tasks are offloaded by the host to the
remote M3 and/or C64x+ slave processors (by an IPC subsystem called Syslink).</p>
<p>To achieve fast message-based communications, a minimal kernel support
is needed to deliver messages arriving from a remote processor to the
appropriate user process.</p>
<p>This communication is based on simple data structures that is shared between
the remote processors, and access to it is synchronized using the hwspinlock
module (remote processor directly places new messages in this shared data
structure).</p>
<p>A common hwspinlock interface makes it possible to have generic, platform-
independent, drivers.</p>

</div>
<p>Dynamically assign an hwspinlock and return its address, or NULL

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>struct hwspinlock *hwspin_lock_request_specific(unsigned int id);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Assign a specific hwspinlock id and return its address, or NULL
if that hwspinlock is already in use. Usually board code will
be calling this function in order to reserve specific hwspinlock
ids for predefined purposes.</p>
<p>Should be called from a process context (might sleep).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int of_hwspin_lock_get_id(struct device_node *np, int index);

</div>
<p>Retrieve the global lock id for an OF phandle-based specific lock.
This function provides a means for DT users of a hwspinlock module
to get the global lock id of a specific hwspinlock, so that it can
be requested using the normal hwspin_lock_request_specific() API.</p>
<p>The function returns a lock id number on success, -EPROBE_DEFER if
the hwspinlock device is not yet registered with the core, or other

the caller must not sleep, and is advised to release the hwspinlock as
soon as possible, in order to minimize remote cores polling on the
hardware interconnect.</p>

<p>The -&gt;unlock() callback releases the lock. It always succeed, and it, too,
may <strong>not</strong> sleep.</p>
<p>The -&gt;relax() callback is optional. It is called by hwspinlock core while
spinning on a lock, and can be used by the underlying implementation to force
a delay between two successive invocations of -&gt;trylock(). It may <strong>not</strong> sleep.</p>
